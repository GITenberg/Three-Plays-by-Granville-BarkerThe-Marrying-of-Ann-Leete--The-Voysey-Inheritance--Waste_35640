<p class="direct1"><i>The first three acts of the comedy pass in the garden at
Markswayde</i>, <span class="smcap">mr. carnaby leete's</span> <i>house near
Reading, during a summer day towards the close
of the eighteenth century: the first act at four in
the morning, the second shortly after mid-day, the
third near to sunset. The fourth act takes place one
day in the following winter; the first scene in the
hall at Markswayde, the second scene in a cottage
some ten miles off.</i></p>

<p class="direct1"><i>This part of the Markswayde garden looks to have been
laid out during the seventeenth century. In the
middle a fountain; the centrepiece the figure of a
nymph, now somewhat cracked, and pouring nothing
from the amphora; the rim of the fountain is high
enough and broad enough to be a comfortable seat.</i></p>

<p class="direct1"><i>The close turf around is in parts worn bare. This plot of
ground is surrounded by a terrace three feet higher.
Three sides of it are seen. From two corners broad
steps lead down; stone urns stand at the bottom and
top of the stone balustrades. The other two corners
are rounded convexly into broad stone seats.</i></p>

<p class="direct1"><i>Along the edges of the terrace are growing rose trees,
close together; behind these, paths; behind those,
shrubs and trees. No landscape is to be seen. A
big copper beech overshadows the seat on the left.
A silver birch droops over the seat on the right. The
trees far to the left indicate an orchard, the few to the
right are more of the garden sort. It is the height
of summer, and after a long drought the rose trees are
dilapidated.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p class="direct1"><i>It is very dark in the garden. Though there may be
by now a faint morning light in the sky it has not
penetrated yet among these trees. It is very still,
too. Now and then the leaves of a tree are stirred,
as if in its sleep; that is all. Suddenly a shrill,
frightened, but not tragical scream is heard. After a
moment</i> <span class="smcap">ann leete</span> <i>runs quickly down the steps and on
to the fountain, where she stops, panting</i>. <span class="smcap">lord john
carp</span> <i>follows her, but only to the top of the steps, evidently
not knowing his way</i>. <span class="smcap">ann</span> <i>is a girl of twenty;
he an English gentleman, nearer forty than thirty</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I apologise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it so dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you hear what I'm saying?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I apologise for having kissed you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
almost unintentionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Mind the steps down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I'm sober, but the air&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we sit for a minute? There are several
seats to sit on somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very dark garden.</p>

<p class="direct4"><i>There is a slight pause.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've won your bet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you did scream!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn't fair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't reproach me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody's coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How d'you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can hear somebody coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're not sitting down.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">ann's</span> <i>brother</i>, <span class="smcap">george leete</span> <i>comes to the top of the
steps, and afterwards down them. Rather an old
young man.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lord!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't see you. I'm sent to say we're all
anxious to know what ghost or other bird of night or beast
has frightened Ann to screaming point, and won you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
best in Tatton's stables&mdash;so he says now. He's quite
annoyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mare is a very good mare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He betted it because he wanted to bet it; I didn't
want him to bet it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What frightened her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had rather, my lord, that you did not tell my
brother why I screamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had rather, Lord John, that you had not told
my brother why I screamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I misunderstood you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've broke up the whist party. Ann, shall
we return?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She's not here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">lady cottesham, ann's</span> <i>sister and ten years older,
and</i> <span class="smcap">mr. daniel tatton</span>, <i>a well-living, middle-aged
country gentleman, arrive together</i>. <span class="smcap">tatton</span> <i>carries
a double candlestick.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the lights out</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three steps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. four.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Leete.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">tatton</span> <i>in the darkness finds himself close to</i> <span class="smcap">george</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in a rage with you, my lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives next door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He passes on.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confess
that she did it to please you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screamed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost my bet. We'll say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. won your
bet&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to please you. Was skeered at the dark&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
oh, fie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Leete trod on a toad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I barred toads&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I barred toads. Did I forget to? Well
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's better to be a sportsman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whereabout is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>From the corner she has slunk to.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I am,
Sally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Ann, I forgive you. I'm smiling,
I assure you, I'm smiling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all laughed when we heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which reminds me, young George Leete,
had you the ace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here are the cards,
but I can't see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Quietly to her sister.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kissed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were trumps?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were we playing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cricket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>As quietly again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you think I'm blushing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's probable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am by the feel of me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George, we left Papa sitting quite still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn't he approve of the bet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, who doesn't love sport!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the man to grumble. Back a woman's
pluck again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never. My lord&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you weren't the
one to go with her as umpire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it I let that pass? Playing
two games at once. Haven't I cause of complaint? But
a man must give and take.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The master of the house, father of</i> <span class="smcap">george</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">sarah cottesham</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">ann, mr. carnaby leete</span>,
<i>comes slowly down the steps, unnoticed by the others.
A man over fifty&mdash;&agrave; la Lord Chesterfield</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">lord john.</span>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure you're quite
comfortable there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever I'm sitting on hasn't given way
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget that you're riding to Brighton
with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the hour before sunrise
is no time at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-five miles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we all sitting here for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say people ought to be in bed and
asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">carnaby.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the morning air is delightful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Jumping at the new voice.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leete! Now,
had you the ace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">carnaby.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have lost that too, Lady
Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear up, Mr. Tat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, a game of whist is a game of whist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">carnaby.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I strolled out after you all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trod on a toad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">carnaby.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Carelessly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she say so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With mock roguishness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">george</span> <i>is on the terrace, looking to the left through

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the sun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to show us ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">carnaby.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coat-tails, Tatton&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or worse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Ruefully discovering damp spots about
him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing vastly to matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lord john.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardy, well-preserved, country gentleman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. tatton.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bet I'm a younger man than you, my
lord.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Suddenly to the company generally.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't
tread upon any toad&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was kissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me the rules&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for next time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been most advantageous for us
to have formed an alliance with Lord John Carp, who
stood here for his father and his father's party&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now
in opposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look upon yourself&mdash;not too seriously&mdash;Ann,
as the instrument of political destiny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid I take in fresh ideas very slowly. Why
has Papa given up the Stamp Office?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His colleagues wouldn't support him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They disapproved of what he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he do right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. giving it up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope so. Time will tell. An irreverent

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if his true enemies think him wise
to have dropped off the Stamp Office?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he quarrelled with Sir Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't that awkward for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear a statement that includes our lives.

the house will be ours. The debts are paid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there remains me.</p>

to go over to the enemy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for the second time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One party is as good as another; each works
for the same end, I should hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't argue about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose that a woman's profession is marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">george.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lord has departed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be others to come. I'm not afraid of
being married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">sarah.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Papa want Mrs. Opie for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">ann.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll be a great many things I shall want to

<p><i>The hall at Markswayde is square; in decoration strictly
eighteenth century. The floor polished. Then comes six
feet of soberly painted wainscot and above the greenish blue
and yellowish green wall painted into panels. At intervals
are low relief pilasters; the capitals of these are gilded.
The ceiling is white and in the centre of it there is a frosted
glass dome through which a dull light struggles. Two sides
only of the hall are seen.</i></p>

<p><i>In the corner is a hat stand and on it are many cloaks
and hats and beneath it several pairs of very muddy boots.</i></p>

<p><i>In the middle of the left hand wall are the double doors
of the dining-room led up to by three or four stairs with
balusters, and on either side standing against the wall long,
formal, straight backed sofas.</i></p>

<p><i>In the middle of the right hand wall is the front door;
glass double doors can be seen and there is evidently a porch
beyond. On the left of the front door a small window. On
the right a large fireplace, in which a large fire is roaring.
Over the front door, a clock (the hands pointing to half-past
one.) Over the fireplace a family portrait (temp. Queen
Anne) below this a blunderbuss and several horse-pistols.
Above the sofa full-length family portraits (temp. George I.)
Before the front door a wooden screen, of lighter wood than
the wainscot, and in the middle of it a small glass panel.
Before this a heavy square table on which are whips and
sticks, a hat or two and brushes; by the table a wooden chair.
On either side the fire stand tall closed-in armchairs, and
between the fireplace and the door a smaller red-baize screen.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

Mr. Voysey's own room into which he walks about twenty past ten of a
morning radiates enterprise besides. There is polish on everything; on
the windows, on the mahogany of the tidily packed writing table that
stands between them, on the brasswork of the fireplace in the other
wall, on the glass of the fire-screen which preserves only the
pleasantness of a sparkling fire, even on Mr. Voysey's hat as he takes
it off to place it on the little red curtained shelf behind the door.
Mr. Voysey is sixty or more and masterful; would obviously be master
anywhere from his own home outwards, or wreck the situation in his
attempt. Indeed there is a buccaneering air sometimes in the twist of
his glance, not altogether suitable to a family solicitor. On this
bright October morning, Peacey, the head clerk, follows just too late to
help him off with his coat, but in time to take it and hang it up with a
quite unnecessary subservience. Mr. Voysey is evidently not capable
enough to like capable men about him. Peacey, not quite removed from
Nature, has made some attempts to acquire protective colouring. A very
drunken client might mistake him for his master. His voice very easily
became a toneless echo of Mr. Voysey's; later his features caught a line
or two from that mirror of all the necessary virtues into which he was
so constantly gazing; but how his clothes even when new contrive to look</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<i>like old ones of Mr. Voysey's is a mystery, and to his tailor a
most annoying one. And Peacey is just a respectful number of years his
master's junior. Relieved of his coat, Mr. Voysey carries to his table
the bunch of beautiful roses he is accustomed to bring to the office
three times a week and places them for a moment only near the bowl of
water there ready to receive them while he takes up his letters. These
lie ready too, opened mostly, one or two private ones left closed and
discreetly separate. By this time the usual salutations have passed,
Peacey's "Good morning, sir;" Mr. Voysey's "Morning, Peacey." Then as he
gets to his letters Mr. Voysey starts his day's work.</i></p>

marked that with a query. There's eight thousand five

her Banker's receipts for cheques on account of those
dividends. I presume for those dividends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>gravely.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because then, Father, there are
Banker's half yearly receipts for sums amounting to an
average of four hundred and twenty pounds a year. But I
find no record of any capital to produce this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, my dear boy. I shall have lots
to say to you. But let's get quietly through with these
details first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>bitterly now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, this is simple enough.
We're young Hatherley's only trustees till his coming of
age in about five years' time. The property was eighteen
thousand invested in Consols. Certain sums were to be
allowed for his education; these have been and are still
being paid. There is no record as to the rest of the
capital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I beg your pardon, sir. There's
a memorandum to refer to the Bletchley Land Scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That must be ten years ago. But he's
credited with the interest on his capital?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On paper, sir. The balance was to be reinvested.
There's a partial account in your hand writing.
He's credited with the Consol interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I've heard you say that the Bletchley
scheme paid seven and a half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one time. Have you taken the
trouble to calculate what will be due from us to the
lad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital and compound interest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. about
twenty six thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's a large sum. In five years' time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he comes of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that gives us, say four years and
six months in which to think about it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>waits, hopelessly, for his father to speak

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for showing me these, sir. Shall
I put them back in your safe now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you'd better. There's the key.

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry, my dear boy. I wouldn't

morning, I don't know. I came early but some of them

mean to shirk that, father. Perhaps I ought to have
discovered, but those affairs were always in your hands.
I trusted&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I beg your pardon. Oh, it's us&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not
you. Everyone has trusted us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>calmly and kindly still.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't
seem to notice that I'm not breaking my heart like this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the extent of the mischief? When
did it begin? Father, what made you begin it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't begin it.</p>

years!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a little difficult to understand just
at first, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>sententiously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do what we must

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his emotion well cooled by now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps
I'd better just listen quietly while you explain.</p>

heavily into Northern Electrics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you don't know how heavily. When
I discovered the Municipalities were organising the purchase,
I thought of course the stock'd be up a hundred
and forty&mdash;a hundred and fifty in no time. Now Leeds
won't make up her quarrel with the other place&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there'll
be no bill brought in for ten years. I bought at ninety
five. What are they now?</p>

the worst of their parents. I did of mine. It's a pity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no immediate danger. I should
think anyone could see that from the state of these accounts.
There's no actual danger at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that the worst?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his anger rising.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you studied
these two accounts or have you not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, where's the deficiency in Mrs.
Murberry's income&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has she ever gone without a
shilling? What has young Hatherley lost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands to lose&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stands to lose nothing if I'm spared
for a little, and you will only bring a little common sense
to bear and try to understand the difficulties of my position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, I'm not thinking ill of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is,
I'm trying not to. But won't you explain how you're
justified&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In putting our affairs in order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you doing that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>starting patiently to examine the matter.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
How bad were things when you first came to control them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pretty bad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know how it was my grandfather
began to&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muddlement, muddlement! Then the
money went and what was he to do. He'd no capital, no
credit, and was in terror of his life. My dear Edward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
if I hadn't found it out, he'd have confessed to the first man
who came and asked for a balance sheet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what exact sum was he to the bad then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget. Several thousands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But surely it has not taken all these years to
pay off&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, hasn't it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>making his point.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how does it happen,
sir, that such a comparatively recent trust as young Hatherley's
had been broken into?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what could be safer than to use
that money? There's a Consol investment and not a sight
wanted of either capital or interest for five years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>utterly beaten.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, are you mad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly not. My practice is to reinvest
my clients' money when it is entirely under my control.
The difference between the income this money has to
bring to them and the income it is actually bringing to me
I utilise in my endeavour to fill up the deficit in the firm's
accounts&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in fact to try and put things straight.
Doesn't it follow that the more low interest bearing capital
I can use the better&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the less risky things I have to put
it into. Most of young Hatherley's Consol capital is out
on mortgage at four and a half and five&nbsp;.&nbsp;. safe as safe
can be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he should have the benefit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has the amount of his consol interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the mortgages in his name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some of them. That's
a technical matter. With regard to Mrs. Murberry&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
those Fretworthy Bonds at my bank&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I've raised five
thousand on them. I can release her Bonds to-morrow
if she wants them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where's the five thousand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was paid into my
private account. Yes, I do remember. Some of it went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
to complete a purchase&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that and two thousand more
out of the Skipworth fund.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, my dear father&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>summing it all up very simply.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not
right.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>considers his son for a moment with a
pitying shake of the head</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why is it so hard for a man to see
clearly beyond the letter of the law! Will you consider
a moment, Edward, the position in which I found myself?
Was I to see my father ruined and disgraced without
lifting a finger to help him?&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not to mention the interest
of the clients. I paid back to the man who would have lost
most by my father's mistakes every penny of his money.
He never knew the danger he'd been in&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never passed
an uneasy moment about it. It was I who lay awake.
I have now somewhere a letter from that man to my father
thanking him effusively for the way in which he'd conducted
some matter. It comforted my poor father. Well,
Edward, I stepped outside the letter of the law to do that.
Was that right or wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its result, sir, right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge me by the result. I took the
risk of failure&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should have suffered. I could have
kept clear of the danger if I'd liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's all past. The thing that concerns
me is what you are doing now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>gently reproachful now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My boy, you
must trust me a little. It's all very well for you to come
in at the end of the day and criticise. But I who have
done the day's work know how that work had to be done.
And here's our firm, prosperous, respected and without
a stain on its honour. That's the main point, isn't it?
And I think that achievement should earn me the right
to be trusted a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shouldn't it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>quite irresponsive to this pathetic appeal.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Look here, sir, I'm dismissing from my mind all prejudice
about speaking the truth&nbsp;.&nbsp;. acting upon one's instructions,
behaving as any honest firm of solicitors must behave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not, I tell no unnecessary lies.
If a man of any business ability gives me definite instructions
about his property, I follow them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, no unnecessary lies!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my friend, go and tell Mrs. Murberry
that four hundred and twenty pounds of her income hasn't
for the last eight years come from the place she thinks it's
come from and see how happy you'll make her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But is that four hundred and twenty a year
as safe to come to her as it was before you meddled with
the capital?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason why&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the security?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>putting his coping stone on the argument.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My financial ability.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>really not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why, it seems as if you were satisfied with this state of
things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, you really are most unsympathetic
and unreasonable. I give all I have to the firm's
work&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my brain&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my energies&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my whole life.
I can't turn my abilities into hard cash at par&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wish I
could. Do you suppose that if I could establish every one
of these people with a separate and consistent bank balance
to-morrow that I shouldn't do it? Do you suppose
that it's a pleasure&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that it's relaxation to have
these matters continually on one's mind? Do you
suppose&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>thankfully able to meet anger with anger.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
find it impossible to believe that you couldn't somehow
have put things right by now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, do you? Somehow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thirty years the whole system must either
have come hopelessly to grief&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or during that time there
must have been opportunities&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if you're so sure, I hope that when
I'm under ground, you may find them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put everything right with a stroke
of the pen, if it's so easy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're my partner and my son, and
you'll inherit the business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>realizing at last that he has been led to the
edge of this abyss.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why else have I had to tell you all this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very simply.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, I can't. I can't
possibly. I don't think you've any right to ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's perpetuating the dishonesty.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>hardens at the unpleasant word</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't believe that I've told you the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no proof&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that I've earned these
twenty or thirty people their incomes for the last&mdash;how
many years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether what you have done and are doing
is wrong or right&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can't meddle in it.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>For the moment</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>looks a little dangerous</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well. Forget all I've said. Go
back to your room. Get back to your own mean drudgery.
My life's work&mdash;my splendid life's work&mdash;ruined! What
does that matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever did you expect of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>making a feint at his papers.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh,
nothing, nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Then he slams them down with great

and devotion and self sacrifice&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a great arch you may
call it&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a bridge which is to carry our firm to safety with
honour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>This variation of Disraeli passes unnoticed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
work! And now, as I near the end of my life, it still lacks
the key-stone. Perhaps I am to die with my work just
incomplete. Then is there nothing that a son might do?
Do you think I shouldn't be proud of you, Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that
I shouldn't bless you from&mdash;wherever I may be, when
you completed my life's work&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with perhaps just one
kindly thought of your father?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>In spite of this oratory, the situation is gradually
impressing</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen if I&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if I desert
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll protect you as best I can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn't thinking of myself, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with great nonchalance</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I shan't
mind the exposure, you know. It won't make me blush
in my coffin&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you're not so foolish I hope as to
be thinking of the feelings of your brothers and sisters.
Considering how simple it would have been for me to go
to my grave in peace and quiet and let you discover the
whole thing afterwards, the fact that I didn't, that I have
taken some thought for the future of all of you might
perhaps have convinced you that I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! But there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
consult your own safety.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>has begun to pace the room; indecision

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a queer thing to have to make up
one's mind about, isn't it, father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>watching him closely and modulating
his voice.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear boy, I understand the shock to your
feelings that this disclosure must have been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I thought this morning that next week
would see us in the dock together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I suppose if I'd broken down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
begged your pardon for my folly, you'd have done anything
for me, gone to prison smiling, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's easy enough to forgive. I'm
sorry I can't go in sack cloth and ashes to oblige you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Now he begins to rally his son; easy in his strength.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My dear Edward, you've lived a quiet humdrum life up
to now, with your books and your philosophy and your
agnosticism and your ethics of this and your ethics of
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dear me, these are the sort of garden oats
which young men seem to sow now-a-days!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you've
never before been brought face to face with any really
vital question. Now don't make a fool of yourself just
through inexperience. Try and give your mind freely
and unprejudicedly to the consideration of this very serious
matter. I'm not angry at what you've said to me. I'm
quite willing to forget it. And it's for your own sake and
not for mine, Edward, that I do beg you to&mdash;to&mdash;to be a man
and try and take a practical common sense view of the
position you find yourself in. It's not a pleasant position
I know, but it's unavoidable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have told me before you took me
into partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Oddly enough it is this last flicker of
rebellion which breaks down</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey's</span> <i>caution. Now
he lets fly with a vengeance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I be telling you at all if I could
possibly help it? Don't I know that you're about as fit for
this job as a babe unborn? Haven't I been worrying over
that for these last three years? But I'm in a corner&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
I won't see all this work of mine come to smash simply because
of your scruples. If you're a son of mine you'll
do as I tell you. Hadn't I the same choice to make?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and this is a safer game for you than it was for me then.
D'you suppose I didn't have scruples? If you run away
from this, Edward, you're a coward. My father was a
coward and he suffered for it to the end of his days. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sick-nurse to him here more than partner. Good lord!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
of course it's pleasant and comfortable to keep within the
law&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then the law will look after you. Otherwise you
have to look pretty sharp after yourself. You have to
cultivate your own sense of right and wrong; deal your own
justice. But that makes a bigger man of you, let me tell
you. How easily&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how easily could I have walked out
of my father's office and left him to his fate; no one would
have blamed me! But I didn't. I thought it my better
duty to stay and&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, I say it with all reverence&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to
take up my cross. Well, I've carried that cross pretty
successfully. And what's more, it's made a happy man of
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a better, stronger man than skulking about in
shame and in fear of his life ever made of my poor dear
father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Relieved at having let out the truth, but doubtful
of his wisdom in doing so, he changes his tone.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't
want what I've been saying to influence you, Edward.
You are a free agent&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you must decide upon your
own course of action. Now don't let's discuss the matter
any more for the moment.</p>

you mustn't imagine that the whole world is standing on

of news. You come down to Chislehurst to-night&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
well, say to-morrow night. It'll be good for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. stop
your brooding&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's your worst vice, Edward. You'll
find the household as if nothing had happened. Then
you'll remember that nothing really has happened. And
presently you'll get to see that nothing need happen, if
you keep your head. I remember times, when things
have seemed at their worst, what a relief it's been to me
.&nbsp;. my romp with you all in the nursery just before your
bed time. Do you remember?</p>

prison to-morrow, I wouldn't wish a single thing I've ever
done undone. I have never wilfully harmed man or

<p class="direct1"><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">voysey</span> <i>dining-room at Chislehurst, when children
and grandchildren are visiting, is dining table
and very little else. And at this moment in the
evening when five or six men are sprawling back in
their chairs, and the air is clouded with smoke, it is
a very typical specimen of the middle-class English
domestic temple; the daily sacrifice consummated, the
acolytes dismissed, the women safely in the drawing
room, and the chief priests of it taking their surfeited

red-papered walls, (like a refection, they are, of the
underdone beef so much consumed within them)
the usual varnished woodwork which is known
as grained oak; there is the usual, hot, mahogany
furniture; and, commanding point of the whole
room, there is the usual black-marble sarcophagus
of a fireplace. Above this hangs one of the two
or three oil paintings, which are all that break
the red pattern of the walls, the portrait painted
in 1880 of an undistinguished looking gentleman
aged sixty; he is shown sitting in a more graceful
attitude than it could ever have been comfortable
for him to assume.</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey's</span> <i>father it is, and
the brass plate at the bottom of the frame tells us
that the portrait was a presentation one. On the
mantelpiece stands, of course, a clock; at either
end a china vase filled with paper spills. And
in front of the fire,&mdash;since that is the post of vantage,
stands at this moment</i> <span class="smcap">major booth voysey</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>He is the second son, of the age that it is necessary
for a Major to be, and of an appearance that many
ordinary Majors in ordinary regiments are. He
went into the army because he thought it would be
like a schoolboy's idea of it; and, being there, he
does his little all to keep it so. He stands astride,
hands in pockets, coat-tails through his arms, cigar
in mouth, moustache bristling. On either side of
him sits at the table an old gentleman; the one is</i>
<span class="smcap">mr. evan colpus</span>, <i>the vicar of their parish, the
other</i> <span class="smcap">mr. george booth</span>, <i>a friend of long standing,
and the Major's godfather. Mr. Colpus is a harmless
enough anachronism, except for the waste of &#163;400
a year in which his stipend involves the community.
Leaving most of his parochial work to an energetic
curate, he devotes his serious attention to the composition
of two sermons a week. They deal with the
difficulties of living the christian life as experienced
by people who have nothing else to do. Published
in series from time to time, these form suitable presents
for bedridden parishioners.</i> <span class="smcap">mr. george booth</span>,
<i>on the contrary, is as gay an old gentleman as
can be found in Chislehurst. An only son; his
father left him at the age of twenty-five a fortune of a
hundred thousand pounds (a plum, as he called it).
At the same time he had the good sense to dispose
of his father's business, into which he had been most
unwillingly introduced five years earlier, for a like
sum before he was able to depreciate its value. It
was</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey's</span> <i>invaluable assistance in this
transaction which first bound the two together in
great friendship. Since that time Mr. Booth has been
bent on nothing but enjoying himself. He has even
remained a bachelor with that object. Money has
given him all he wants, therefore he loves and reverences
money; while his imagination may be estimated</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>

still possessing more of it than he knows what
to do with. At the head of the table, meditatively
cracking walnuts, sits</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span>. <i>He has his
back there to the conservatory door&mdash;you know it is
the conservatory door because there is a curtain to
pull over it, and because half of it is frosted glass
with a purple key pattern round the edge. On</i> <span class="smcap">mr.
voysey's</span> <i>left is</i> <span class="smcap">denis tregoning</span>, <i>a nice enough
young man. And at the other end of the table sits</i>
<span class="smcap">edward</span>, <i>not smoking, not talking, hardly listening,
very depressed. Behind him is the ordinary door
of the room, which leads out into the dismal draughty
hall. The Major's voice is like the sound of a
cannon through the tobacco smoke.</i></p>

Just one moment. Have you thought of the physical

manhood of the country? What England wants is Chest!

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five pounds more; she has promised
me five pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then how will the debt stand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-three&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, thirty-two pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're a long time clearing it off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>gently querulous.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, now that the
window is up, people don't seem so ready to contribute
as they were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">tregoning.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must mention that to Hugh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>tactful at once.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that the work is
not universally admired. I have heard Hugh's design
praised by quite competent judges. But certainly I feel
now it might have been wiser to have delayed the unveiling
until the money was forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as it was my wish that my son should

<p><span class="smcap">major booth voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonymously.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that would be&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, why should I? Here, George Booth,
you shall halve it with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm damned if I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>proceeding, conveniently deaf.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember
that at the meeting we had of the parents and
friends to decide on the positions of the names of the poor
fellows and the regiments and coats of arms and so on&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
when Hugh said so violently that he disapproved of the
war and made all those remarks about land-lords and
Bibles and said he thought of putting in a figure of Britannia
blushing for shame or something&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm beginning
to fear that may have created a bad impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">major booth voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should they mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
what on earth does Hugh know about war? He couldn't
tell a battery horse from a bandsman. I don't pretend
to criticise art. I think the window'd be very pretty
if it wasn't so broken up into bits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>fortified by his "damned" and
his last glass of port.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young men are so ready with
their disapproval. Criticism starts in the cradle nowadays.
When I was young, people weren't always questioning this
and questioning that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">major booth voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>hurrying on.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way a man
now even stops to think what he's eating and drinking.
And in religious matters&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Vicar, I put it to you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
there's no uniformity at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. colpus.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I try to keep myself free from the
disturbing influences of modern thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young men must be forming
their own opinions about this and their opinions about
that. You know, Edward, you're worse even than Hugh
is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>glancing up mildly at this sudden attack.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What have I done, Mr. Booth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>not the readiest of men.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
aren't you one of those young men who go about the
world making difficulties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of difficulties?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>triumphantly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
never can make out. Surely when you're young you can
ask the advice of your elders and when you grow up you
find Laws&nbsp;.&nbsp;. lots of laws divine and human laid down for
our guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Well in possession of the conversation
he spreads his little self.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look back over a fairly long
life and&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps I should say by Heaven's help&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
find nothing that I can honestly reproach myself with.
And yet I don't think I ever took more than five minutes
to come to a decision upon any important point. One's
private life is, I think, one's own affair&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should allow
no one to pry into that. But as to worldly things&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well,
I have come into several sums of money and my capital
is still intact&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ask your father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>nods
gravely</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've never robbed any man. I've never lied
over anything that mattered. As a citizen I pay my
taxes without grumbling very much. Yes, and I sent
conscience money too upon one occasion. I consider
that any man who takes the trouble can live the life of a
gentleman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>and he finds that his cigar is out.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">major booth voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>not to be outdone by this display

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if there have been good times there
have been bad times. At present the three hundred a

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three hundred a year&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet you've
never attempted to put a single account straight. Since
it isn't lunacy, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can only conclude that you enjoy
being in this position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put accounts absolutely straight&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
at the winding up of a trust for instance&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at great
inconvenience too. And to all appearances they've been

Edward?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm to remain in the firm, it had better
be with a very clear understanding of things as they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>firmly, not too anxiously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you
do remain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>in a very low voice.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>quite gravely.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's wise of you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

we needn't discuss the impractical side of it any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to make one condition. And I
want some information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his sudden cheerfulness relapsing again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course no one has ever discovered&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
no one suspects this state of things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacey knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peacey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father found out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. Does he draw hush money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>curling a little at the word.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my
custom to make a little present every Christmas. Not a
cheque&nbsp;.&nbsp;. notes in an envelope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He becomes benevolent.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't grudge the money&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Peacey's a devoted fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally this would be a heavily taxed
industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then he smiles at his vision of the mild old clerk.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Peacey! There's another thing I want to ask, sir. Have
you ever under stress of circumstances done worse than
just make use of a client's capital? You boasted to me
yesterday that no one had ever suffered in pocket because
of you. Is that absolutely true?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>draws himself up, dignified and

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Edward, for the future my mind
is open to you, you can discover for yourself how matters
stand to-day. But I decline to gratify your curiosity
as to what is over and done with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with entire comprehension.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you,
sir. The condition I wish to make is that we should
really do what we have pretended to be doing&nbsp;.&nbsp;. try and
put the accounts straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with a little polite shrug.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've no doubt
you'll prove an abler man of business than I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which one will you begin with?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin, Father, by halving the salary
I draw from the firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Retrenchment and Reform.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think you cannot give Ethel this
five thousand pounds dowry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>shortly, with one of the quick twists of
his eye.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my word to Denis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money isn't yours to give.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>in an indignant crescendo.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should
not dream of depriving Ethel of what, as my daughter,
she has every right to expect. I am surprised at your
suggesting such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>pale and firm.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm set on this, Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't be such a fool, Edward. What
would it look like&nbsp;.&nbsp;. suddenly to refuse without
rhyme or reason? What would old Tregoning think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>distressed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could give them a reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you'll invent one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If need be, Ethel should be told the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it would hurt her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Denis told too, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, it is my duty to do whatever is
necessary to prevent this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll be necessary to tell the nearest
policeman. It is my duty to pay no more attention
to these scruples of yours than a nurse pays to her child's
tantrums. Understand, Edward, I don't want to force
you to continue my partner. Come with me gladly or
don't come at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>dully.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my duty to be of what use I
can to you, sir. Father, I want to save you if I can.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He flashes into this exclamation of almost broken-hearted
affection.</i> <span class="smcap">mr. voysey</span> <i>looks at his son for a
moment and his lip quivers. Then he steels himself.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you! I have saved myself quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
satisfactorily for the last thirty years, and you must
please believe that by this time I know my own business
best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>hopelessly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the money come some
other way. How is your own income regulated?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a bank balance and a cheque book,
haven't I? I spend what I think well to spend. What's
the use of earmarking this or that as my own? You say
none of it is my own. I might say it's all my own. I think
I've earned it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>anger coming on him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what I can't
forgive. If you'd lived poor&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you'd really devoted
your skill to your clients' good and not to your aggrandisement
.&nbsp;. then, even though things were only as they are
now, I could have been proud of you. But, Father,
own the truth to me, at least&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's my due from you,
considering how I'm placed by all you've done. Didn't
you simply seize this opportunity as a means to your own
end, to your own enriching?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with a sledge hammer irony.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly.
I sat that morning in my father's office, studying
the helmet of the policeman in the street below, and
thinking what a glorious path I had happened on to
wealth and honour and renown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Then he begins to bully</i>
<span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>in the kindliest way.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear boy, you evidently
haven't begun to grasp the A. B. C. of my position.
What has carried me to victory? The confidence of my
clients. What has earned that confidence? A decent life,
my integrity, my brains? No, my reputation for wealth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
that, and nothing else. Business now-a-days is run on the
lines of the confidence trick. What makes old George
Booth so glad to trust me with every penny he possesses?
Not affection&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he's never cared for anything in his
life but his collection of prints. No; he imagines that
I have as big a stake in the country, as he calls it, as he
has and he's perfectly happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>stupefied, helpless.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he's involved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course he's involved, and he's always
after high interest too&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's little one makes out of him.
But there's a further question here, Edward. Should I
have had confidence in myself, if I'd remained a poor man?
No, I should not. You must either be the master of
money or its servant. And if one is not opulent in one's
daily life one loses that wonderful&nbsp;.&nbsp;. financier's touch.
One must be confident oneself&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I saw from the
first that I must inspire confidence. My whole public
and private life has tended to that. All my surroundings
.&nbsp;. you and your brothers and sisters that I have
brought into, and up, and put out in the world
so worthily&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you in your turn inspire confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not our worth, not our abilities, nor our
virtues, but the fact that we travel first class and ride in
hansoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>impatiently.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I haven't organised
Society upon a basis of wealth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is every single person who trusts you involved
in your system?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What new hole are you finding to pick
in my conduct?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind travelled naturally from George
Booth with his big income to old Nursie with her savings
which she brought you to invest. You've let those be, at
least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never troubled to invest them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
wasn't worth while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you know what she brought me?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
five hundred pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's damnable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed. I give her seventy five pounds a
year for it. Would you like to take charge of that account,
Edward? I'll give you five hundred to invest to-morrow.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span>, <i>hopelessly beaten, falls into an almost
comic state of despair</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Father, putting every moral question
aside&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's all very well your playing Robin Hood
in this magnificent manner; but have you given a moment's
thought to the sort of inheritance you'll be leaving me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>pleased for the first time.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! That is
a question you have every right to ask.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you died to-morrow could we pay eight
shillings in the pound&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or seventeen&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or five? Do
you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my answer is, that by your help
I have every intention, when I die, of leaving a will behind
me of property to you all running into six figures. D'you
think I've given my life and my talents to this money
making for a less result than that? I'm fond of you all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and I want you to be proud of me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I mean that
the name of Voysey shall be carried high in the world by my
children and grandchildren. Don't you be afraid, Edward.
Ah, you lack experience, my boy&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you're not full grown
yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your impulses are a bit chaotic. You emotionalise
over your work, and you reason about your emotions. You
must sort yourself. You must realise that money making
is one thing, and religion another, and family-life a third&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and that if we apply our energies whole-heartedly to each
of these in turn, and realise that different laws govern

<br />

<p class="direct1"><i>The dining room looks very different in the white light
of a July noon. Moreover on this particular day,
it isn't even its normal self. There is a peculiar
luncheon spread on the table. The embroidered cloth
is placed cornerwise and on it are decanters of port
and sherry; sandwiches, biscuits and an uncut cake;
two little piles of plates and one little pile of napkins.
There are no table decorations and indeed the whole
room has been made as bare and as tidy as possible.
Such preparations denote one of the recognised
English festivities, and the appearance of</i> <span class="smcap">phoebe</span>,
<i>the maid, who has just completed them, the set
solemnity of her face and the added touches of black
to her dress and cap, suggest that this is probably
a funeral. When</i> <span class="smcap">mary</span> <i>comes in the fact that she
has evidently been crying and that she decorously
does not raise her voice above an unpleasant whisper
makes it quite certain</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mary.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phoebe, they're coming&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I forgot one
of the blinds in the drawing room.</p>

scarce. I'll open the door.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">mary</span> <i>got rid of</i>, <span class="smcap">phoebe</span> <i>composes her face still more

touch to her apron as well goes to admit the funeral
party. The first to enter are</i> <span class="smcap">mrs. voysey</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">mr.
booth</span>, <i>she on his arm; and the fact that she is in

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Edward?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll come straight to the point which concerns
you. Our father's will gives certain sums to you all&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
gross amount something over a hundred thousand pounds.
There will be no money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>in his mother's ear.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward says there's
no money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>precisely.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you said&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 'will be.'</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>in a tone of mitigated thunder.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will
there be no money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>letting himself go.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because every penny by
right belongs to those clients whom our father spent his
life in defrauding. When I say defrauding, I mean it in
its worst sense&nbsp;.&nbsp;. swindling&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thieving. I have been
in the swim of it, for the past year&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, you don't know
the sink of iniquity&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and therefore I mean to collect
every penny, any money that you can give me; put the firm
into bankruptcy; pay back all these people what we can.
I'll stand my trial&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it'll come to that with me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and as
soon as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he pauses, partly for breath, and glares

right, what is there to be said!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Then with a gentle afterthought.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm sorry to hurt you, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't hear quite all you say, but I
guess what it is. You don't hurt me, Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with almost a cry.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, mother, did he

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>collected and dry.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may as well tell
you, Edward, I suspected everything wasn't right about
the time of my last quarrel with my father. Of course, I
took care not to pursue my suspicions. Was father aware
that you knew, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never discussed it. There was once
a great danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when you were all younger&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of his
being found out. But we never discussed it.</p>

thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>a little impatient at this exhibition.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's the worst of these family practices&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a lot of money
knocking around and no audit ever required. The wonder
to me is to find an honest solicitor at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really, Trenchard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the more able a man is the less
the word Honesty bothers him&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the Pater was an
able man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that a year ago, Trenchard. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
thought that at the worst he was a splendid criminal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really&nbsp;.&nbsp;. really, Edward!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everything was to come right in the
end&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we were all to be in reality as wealthy and as
prosperous as we have seemed to be all these years. But
when he fell ill&nbsp;.&nbsp;. towards the last he couldn't keep the
facts from me any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those are?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughable. You wouldn't believe there
were such fools in the world as some of these wretched
clients have been. I tell you the firm's funds were just
a lucky bag into which he dipped. Now sometimes their
money doesn't even exist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where's it gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very directly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been living on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can you pay in the pound?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without help?&nbsp;.&nbsp;. six or seven shillings, I
daresay. But we must do better than that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>To which there is no response.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this is very dreadful. Does it mean
beggary for the whole family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it should.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Pater never touched his money&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very curious his evolving that fiction

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain sympathy, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one can trace the psychology of

do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urged him to start by making some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
smaller accounts right. He said&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he said that would
be penny wise and pound foolish. So I did what I could
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your own money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little I had.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you prove that you did that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a good point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>not to be quite left out.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I must say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You ought to have written him a letter,
and left the firm the moment you found out. Even then,
legally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! But as he was your father. What was
his object in telling you? What did he expect you to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've thought of every reason&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and now I
really believe it was that he might have someone to boast
to of his financial exploits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>appreciatively.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I daresay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely matters to boast of!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you try playing the fool with other
people's money, and keeping your neck out of the noose
for twelve years. It's not so easy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, he always protested that
things would come right&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that he'd clear the firm and
have a fortune to the good. Or that if he were not spared
I might do it. But he must have known that was
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's the gambler all over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he actually took the trouble to draw
up this will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was childish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm the sole executor.</p>

by the grave&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Colpus reading the service&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the Vicar's badly hit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the Pater had managed his business for
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good God&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how shall we ever look old
Booth in the face again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't worry about him; he can die quite
comfortably enough on six shillings in the pound. It's
one or two of the smaller fry who will suffer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, just explain to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I didn't interrupt
while Trenchard was talking&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of what exactly did this
defrauding consist?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speculating with a client's capital&nbsp;.&nbsp;. pocketing
the gains, cutting the losses; meanwhile paying the
client his ordinary income.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that he didn't find it out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact, he doesn't suffer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn't suffer till he finds it out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that's wrong now is that some of their
capital is missing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>half amused, half amazed at this process
of reasoning.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that's all that's wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the ah&mdash;deficit?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>the word rolls from
his tongue.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything between two and three hundred
thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very impressed and not unfavourably.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is a big affair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>following his own line of thought.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite
apart from the rights and wrongs of this, only a very able
man could have kept a straight face to the world
all these years, as the Pater did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose he sometimes made money by these
speculations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often. His own expenditure was heavy,
as you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with gratitude for favours received.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was
a very generous man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did nobody ever suspect him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Hugh, when there was any danger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
when a trust had to be wound up&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he'd make a great
effort and put the accounts straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he did put some accounts straight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, when he couldn't help himself.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">booth</span> <i>looks very enquiring and then squares himself
up to the subject</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now look here, Edward. You told us that
he told you that it was the object of his life to put these
accounts straight. Then you laughed at that. Now you
tell me that he did put some accounts straight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>wearily.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Booth, you don't
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let me understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am anxious to
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't pay ten shillings in the pound.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's very dreadful. But do you know that
there wasn't a time when we couldn't have paid five?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>acquiescent.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well then! If what he said was true about
his father and all that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and why shouldn't we believe
him if we can?&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he did effect an improvement,
that's all to his credit. Let us at least be just, Edward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>patiently polite.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very sorry to appear
unjust. He has left me in a rather unfortunate
position.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, his death was a tragedy. It seems to me
that if he had been spared he might have succeeded
at length in this tremendous task and restored to us our
family honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Booth, he spoke very feelingly of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Irony lost upon him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can well believe it.
And I can tell you that now&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I may be right or I may
be wrong&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am feeling far less concerned about the
clients' money than I am at the terrible blow to the Family
which this exposure will strike. Money, after all, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
to a certain extent be done without&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but Honour&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This is too much for</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our honour! Does one of you mean to give
me a single penny towards undoing all the wrong that has
been done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take Trenchard's word for it that that
would be illegal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don't talk to me of honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>somewhat nettled at this outburst.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am
speaking of the public exposure. Edward, can't that be
prevented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with quick suspicion.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how was it being prevented before
he died&mdash;before we knew anything about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>appealing to the spirits that watch over him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oh, listen to this! First Trenchard&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and now you!
You've the poison in your blood, every one of you. Who
am I to talk? I daresay so have I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>reprovingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am beginning to think that
you have worked yourself into rather an hysterical state
over this unhappy business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>rating him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you'd have been
glad&nbsp;.&nbsp;. glad if I'd held my tongue and gone on lying and
cheating&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and married and begotten a son to go on
lying and cheating after me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and to pay you your
interest&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your interest in the lie and the cheat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with statesman-like calm.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here, Edward,
this rhetoric is exceedingly out of place. The simple
question before us is&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What is the best course to pursue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question before us. There's
only one course to pursue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>crushingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will let me speak, please.
In so far as our poor father was dishonest to his clients,
I pray that he may be forgiven. In so far as he spent
his life honestly endeavouring to right a wrong which he
had found already committed&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I forgive him. I admire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
him, Edward. And I feel it my duty to&mdash;er&mdash;reprobate
most strongly the&mdash;er&mdash;gusto with which you have been
holding him up in memory to us&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ten minutes after we
have stood round his grave&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a monster of wickedness.
I think I may say I knew him as well as you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better.
And&nbsp;.&nbsp;. thank God!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there was not between him and
me this&mdash;this unhappy business to warp my judgment of
him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he warms to his subject.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever know a
more charitable man&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a larger-hearted? He was a
faithful husband&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what a father to all of us, putting
us out into the world and fully intending to leave us
comfortably settled there. Further&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I see this
matter, Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when as a young man he was told
this terrible secret and entrusted with such a frightful
task&nbsp;.&nbsp;. did he turn his back on it like a coward? No.
He went through it heroically to the end of his life. And
as he died I imagine there was no more torturing thought
than that he had left his work unfinished.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he is very
satisfied with this peroration.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now if all these
clients can be kept receiving their natural income and if
Father's plan could be carried out of gradually replacing
the capital&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>at this raises his head and stares with horror</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're appealing to me to carry on this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Oh, you don't know what you're talking about!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Major, having talked himself back to a proper
eminence remains good-tempered.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'm not a conceited man&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I do
think that I can understand a simple financial problem
when it has been explained to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't know the nerve&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the unscrupulous
daring it requires to&mdash;</p>

very angry. Here am I doing my best to help you and
your clients&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and there you sit imputing to me the most
sordid motives. Do you suppose I should touch or allow
to be touched the money which father has left us till
every client's claim was satisfied?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Booth, I'm sure you mean well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll come down to your office and work with
you.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this cheerful prospect even poor</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>can't

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, you'd be found out at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>feeling that it is a chance lost.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,
of course the Pater never consulted me. I only know
what I feel ought to be possible. I can but make the
suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trenchard.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you coming, Booth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, certainly. I'll talk this over with Trenchard.
[<i>as he gets up and automatically stiffens, he is reminded
of the occasion and his voice drops.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we've
been speaking very loud. You must do nothing rash.
I've no doubt I can devise something which will obviate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and then I'm sure I shall convince you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>glancing into

might be to you all! Booth has made a good recovery.</p>

trespassed against the etiquette of your own profession.
But now he's dead&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if there weren't the disgrace
to think of&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's no use the rest of us pretending to
feel him a criminal, because we don't. Which just shows

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad that didn't happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the fault was his it won't hurt you
so much to stand up to the blame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hurt enough now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, what have the boys done? It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
mercy to tell Honor just at this time. She can grieve
for his death and his disgrace at the same time&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the
one grief lessens the other perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they're all shocked enough at the
disgrace&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but will they open their purses to lessen the
disgrace?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it seem less disgraceful to have stolen ten
thousand pounds than twenty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think so, but I wonder if that's the Law.
If it isn't, Trenchard wouldn't consider the point. I'm
sure Public Opinion doesn't say so&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that's what
Booth is considering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with contempt.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>ever so gently ironical.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he's in the Army&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
he's almost in Society&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he has to get on in both;
one mustn't blame him. Of course if the money could
have been given up with a flourish of trumpets&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! But
even then I doubt whether the advertisement would bring
in what it cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very serious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when one thinks how
the money was obtained!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one thinks how most money is obtained!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They've not earned it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>her eyes humorous.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they had they might
have given it you and earned more. Did I ever tell you
what my guardian said to me when I came of age?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm thankful your money's not been in
danger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might have been, but I was made to look
after it myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;. much against my will. My guardian
was a person of great character and no principles, the best
and most loveable man I've ever met&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm sorry you
never knew him Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he said once to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You've no right to your money. You've not earned it or
deserved it in any way. Therefore don't be surprised or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
annoyed if any enterprising person tries to get it from you.
He has at least as much right to it as you have&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if he
can use it better, he has more right. Shocking sentiments,
aren't they? No respectable man of business could own to
them. But I'm not so sorry for some of these clients as
you are, Edward.</p>

whole life perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has been to sit senselessly by my
father's side and prevent things going from bad to worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was worth doing. The cost is your own
affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there's something else I could do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could take the money that's in my father's

It'd take a few months to do it well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and cover the

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you'd give yourself up as you'd meant

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">peacey</span>, <i>after a moment, makes an effort, purses

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills are beginning to come in upon me as
is usual at this season, sir. My son's allowance at
Cambridge is now rather a heavy item of my expenditure.
I hope that the custom of the firm isn't to be
neglected now that you are the head of it, Mr. Edward.
Two hundred your father always made it at Christmas&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
in notes if you please.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Towards the end of this</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>begins to pay great

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, to be sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your hush money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>bridling.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not a very pleasant word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very unpleasant subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure it isn't my wish to bring out in cold
conversation what I know of the firm's position. Your
father always gave me the notes in an envelope when he
shook hands with me at Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>blandly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've been waiting for you
to ask me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we'll say no more about it. There's
always a bit of friction in coming to an understanding
about anything, isn't there, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why didn't you speak to me about this
last Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew you were upset at your father's death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, my father died the August before
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. truthfully, Mr. Edward?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As truthfully as you think suitable.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The irony of this is wasted on</i> <span class="smcap">peacey</span>, <i>who becomes
pleasantly candid</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I couldn't make you out last Christmas.
I'd always thought there must be a smash when your father
died&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it didn't come. But then again at Christmas
you seemed all on edge and I didn't know what might
happen. So I thought I'd better keep quiet and say
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. This little pull of yours over the firm
is an inheritance from your father, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>discreetly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he retired, sir, he said to
me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I've told the Governor you know what I know.
And Mr. Voysey said to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I treat you as I did your
father, Peacey. I never had another word on the subject
with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very decent arrangement. Your son's at
Cambridge you say, Peacey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder you didn't bring him into the
firm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>taking this very kind.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
thought of it. But then I thought that two generations
going in for this sort of thing was enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a matter of taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, sir&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't want to hurt your
feelings, but things simply cannot go on for ever. The
marvel to me is that the game has been kept up as it has.
So now, if he does well at Cambridge, I hope he'll go to the
bar. He has a distinct talent for patiently applying himself
to the details of a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he'll do well. I'm glad to have had
this talk with you, Peacey. I'm sorry you can't have the
money you want.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He returns to his letters, a little steely-eyed.</i> <span class="smcap">peacey</span>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, any time will do, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't have the money at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very decidedly indeed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I made up
my mind about that eighteen months ago. Since my
father's death the trust business of the firm has not been
conducted as it was formerly. We no longer make illicit
profits out of our clients. There are none for you to share.</p>

up</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here, Mr. Edward, I'm sorry I began
this discussion. You'll give me my two hundred as usual,
please, and we'll drop the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By all means drop the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his voice rising sharply.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the money.
I think it is not gentlemanly in you, Mr. Edward, to make
these excuses to try to get out of paying it me. Your father
would never have made such an excuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>flabbergasted.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think I'm lying to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with a deprecating swallow.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't wish
to criticise your statements or your actions at all, sir. It
was no concern of mine how your father treated his
clients.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand. And now it's no concern of
yours how honest I am. You want your money just the
same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, don't be sarcastic&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a man does get
used to a state of affairs whatever it may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with considerable force.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, if I
drop sarcasm I shall have to tell you very candidly what I
think of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I'm a thief because I've taken money
from a thief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse than a thief. You're content that
others should steal for you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who isn't?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>is really pleased with the aptness of this.
He at once changes his tone, which indeed had
become rather bullying.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Peacey, I perceive that you study
sociology. Well, that's too big a question to enter into
now. The application of the present portion of it is that I
have for the moment, at some inconvenience to myself,
ceased to receive stolen goods and therefore am in a
position to throw a stone at you. I have thrown it.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">peacey</span>, <i>who would far sooner be bullied than talked

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I'm to leave the firm, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not unless you wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to think the secret's worth its price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps someone will pay it you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>feebly threatening.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're presuming upon
its not being worth my while to make use of what I
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>not unkindly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My good Peacey, it happens
to be the truth I told you just now. Well, how on earth
do you suppose you can successfully blackmail a man, who
has so much to gain by exposure and so little to lose as I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>peeving.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to ruin you, sir, and
I have a great regard for the firm&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but you must see
that I can't have my income reduced in this way without a
struggle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with great cheerfulness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well, my
friend, struggle away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his voice rising high and thin.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one
thing, sir, I don't think it fair dealing on your part to dock
the money suddenly. I have been counting on it most of
the year, and I have been led into heavy expenses. Why
couldn't you have warned me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's true, Peacey, it was stupid of me. I
apologise for the mistake.</p>

Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you think that the fascination of
swindling one's clients will ultimately prove irresistible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's what happened to your father, I suppose
you know.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This gives</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>such pause that he drops his

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got things as right as rain once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My father told me. Then he started
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how did you find that out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>expanding pleasantly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, being so long
in his service, I grew to understand your father. But
when I first came into the firm, I simply hated him. He
was that sour; so snappy with everyone&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as if he had a
grievance against the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>pensively.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems he had in those days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as I said, his dealings with his clients
were no business of mine. And I speak as I find. He
was very kind to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. always thoughtful and considerate.
He grew to be so pleasant and generous to everyone&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you have great hopes of me yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>who has a simple mind.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Mr. Edward,
no. You're different from your father&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one must make
up one's mind to that. And you may believe me or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
but I should be very glad to know that the firm was solvent
and going straight. There have been times when I have
sincerely regretted my connection with it. If you'll let
me say so, I think it's very noble of you to have undertaken
the work you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then, as everything seems smooth
again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr. Edward, if you'll give me enough to
cover this year's extra expense I think I may promise
you that I shan't expect money again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>good-tempered, as he would speak to an
importunate child.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Peacey, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>fretful again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sir, you make things
very difficult for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a letter from Mr. Cartwright which
you might attend to. If he wants an appointment with me,

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>breaking in upon this bunch of tags.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
dear Peacey, don't talk nonsense&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you couldn't proceed

irresponsibly for all these years. You'll find you're no

<p><span class="smcap">peacey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't that, sir. But these personalities&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What d'you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with vehemence.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want a machine gun planted
in Regent Street&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and one in the Haymarket&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
one in Leicester Square and one in the Strand&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and a
dozen in the City. An earthquake would be simpler. Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
why not a nice clean tidal wave? It's no good preaching
and patching up any longer, Edward. We must begin
afresh. Don't you feel, even in your calmer moments,
that this whole country is simply hideous? The other
nations must look after themselves. I'm patriotic&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
only ask that we should be destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been promised.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sick of waiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then as</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>says
nothing</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say this is the cry just of the weak man in
despair! I wouldn't be anything but a weak man in this
world. I wouldn't be a king, I wouldn't be rich&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
wouldn't be a Borough Councillor&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should be so
ashamed. I've walked here this morning from Hampstead.
I started to curse because the streets were dirty.
You'd think that an Empire could keep its streets clean!
But then I saw that the children were dirty too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's because of the streets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's holiday time. Those that can cross
a road safely are doing some work now&nbsp;.&nbsp;. earning some
money. You'd think a governing race, grabbing responsibilities,
might care for its children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, we educate them now. And I
don't think many work in holiday time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>encouraged by contradiction.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We teach them
all that we're not ashamed of&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and much that we
ought to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the rest they find out for themselves.
Oh, every man and woman I met was muddy eyed!
They'd joined the great conspiracy which we call our
civilization. They've been educated! They believe in the
Laws and the Money-market and Respectability. Well, at
least they suffer for their beliefs. But I'm glad I don't
make the laws&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that I haven't any money&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
that I hate respectability&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or I should be so ashamed.
By the bye, that's what I've come for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>pleasantly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? I thought you'd only
come to talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must take that money of mine for your
clients. Of course you ought to have had it when you
asked for it. It has never belonged to me. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
has never done me any good. I have never made any
use of it and so it has been just a clog to my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>surprised.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Hugh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is
very generous of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a bit. I only want to start fresh and
free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>sitting back from his work.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh, do you
really think that money has carried a curse with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with great violence.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think! I'm the proof
of it and look at me. When I said I'd be an artist the
governor gave me a hundred and fifty a year&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the rent
of a studio and the price of a velvet coat he thought it;
that was all he knew about art. Then my respectable
training got me engaged and married. Marriage in a
studio puzzled the governor, so he guessed it at <i>two</i>
hundred and fifty a year&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and looked for lay figure-babies,
I suppose. What had I to do with Art? Nothing
I've done yet but reflects our drawing-room at Chislehurst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>considering.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do you earn in
a year? I doubt if you can afford to give this up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you clank the chain with the
best of them. That word Afford! I want to be free from
my advantages. Don't you see I must find out what I'm
worth in myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether I even exist or not? Perhaps
I'm only a pretence of a man animated by an income.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you can't return to nature on the
London pavements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Nor in England at all&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's nothing
but a big back garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>now he collects himself for a final
outburst.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there's no place on this earth where
a man can prove his right to live by some other means than
robbing his neighbour&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'd better go and request the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We mean to separate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first I've heard of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>having considered.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shan't accept this
money from you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there's no need. All the good has
been done that I wanted to do. No one will be beggared
now. So why should you be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with clumsy affection.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've taken a fine
lot of interest in your labours, haven't we, Hercules?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hold your tongue about the office affairs,
don't you? It's not safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will you be quit of the beastly business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>becoming reserved and cold at once.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm
in no hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you gain by hanging on now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occupation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Edward, it must be an awfully wearying
state of things. I suppose any moment a policeman may
knock at the door&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so to speak?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>appreciating the figure of speech.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
moment. I take no precautions. I suppose that's why
he doesn't come. At first I listened for him, day by day.
Then I said to myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;. next week. But a year has
gone by and more. I've ceased expecting to hear the
knock at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look here&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is all this worth while?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>supremely ironical.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Hugh, what
a silly question!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>very seriously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But have you the right to
make a mean thing of your life like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my life matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of course!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find no evidence to convince me of it. The
World that you talk about so finely is using me up. A
little wantonly&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a little needlessly, I do think. But she
knows her own damn business&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or so she says, if you
try to teach it her. And why should I trouble to fit myself
for better work than she has given me to do&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nursing
fools' money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>responding at once to this vein.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, we
must turn this world upside down. It's her stupidity
that drives me mad. We all want a lesson in values.
We're never taught what is worth having and what isn't.
Why should your real happiness be sacrificed to the sham
happiness which people have invested in the firm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose their money means such happiness
to them as they understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we want another currency. We must
learn to express ourselves in terms of vitality. There can
be no other standard of worth in life, can there? I never
believed that money was valuable. I remember once
giving a crossing sweeper a sovereign. The sovereign was
nothing. But the sensation I gave him was an intrinsically
valuable thing.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is fearfully pleased with his essay in philosophy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could buy other sensations with the sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But none like the first.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then the realities of
life overwhelm him again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we're slaves!
Beatrice won't let me go until we're each certain of two
hundred a year. And she's quite right&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should only
get into debt. You know that two fifty a year of mine
is a hundred and eighty now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>mischievous.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would you invest sensationally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with great seriousness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put money into
things which I know ought to succeed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. May one ask why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>relieved that the worst is over.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
certainly. My reason is straightforward and simple and
well considered. I think you must know, Edward, I have
never been able to feel that implicit confidence in your
ability which I had in your father's. Well, it is hardly
to be expected, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with a grim smile.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that without unduly depreciating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
you. Men like your father are few and far between. As
far as I know things proceed at this office as they have
always done but&nbsp;.&nbsp;. since his death I have not been happy
about my affairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>speaking as it is his duty to.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you
need be under no apprehension&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I daresay not. But that isn't the point.
Now, for the first time in my long life I am worried about
money affairs; and I don't like the feeling. The possession
of money has always been a pleasure to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
for what are perhaps my last years I don't wish that to be
otherwise. You must remember you have practically
my entire property unreservedly in your control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps we can arrange to hand you over
the reins to an extent which will ease your mind, and at
the same time not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought of that. Believe me, I have
every wish not to slight unduly your father's son. I have
not moved in the matter for eighteen months. I have not
been able to make up my mind to. Really, one feels a
little helpless&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the transaction of business requires
more energy than&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I saw my doctor yesterday,
Edward, and he told me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it was a warning. And
so I felt it my duty at once to&nbsp;.&nbsp;. especially as I made up
my mind to it some time ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he comes to the end of this
havering at last and adds.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of fact, Edward, more
than a year before your father died I had quite decided
that my affairs could never be with you as they were with
him.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>starts almost out of his chair; his face pale,

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>conciliatory.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall make a point of
informing your family that you are in no way to blame in
the matter. And in the event of any personal legal
difficulties I shall always be delighted to come to you. My

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>still quite unstrung really, and his nerves

my father died to do this, you ought to have told <b>him</b>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to know my own business
best. I did not choose to distress him by&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>pulling himself together: speaking half to
himself.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. this is one way out. And
it's not my fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're making a fearful fuss about a very
simple matter, Edward. The loss of one client, however
important he may be&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, this is one of the best

<p class="direct1"><i>Naturally it is the dining room&mdash;consecrated as it is
to the distinguishing orgie of the season&mdash;which
bears the brunt of what an English household
knows as Christmas decorations. They consist
chiefly of the branches of holly (that unyielding
tree), stuck cock-eyed behind the top edges of the pictures.
The one picture conspicuously not decorated is
that which now hangs over the fireplace, a portrait of</i>

marking it also as a presentation</i>. <span class="smcap">honor</span>, <i>hastily

above it, in time to obviate the shock to family feelings

only difference between the dining room's appearance
at half past nine on Christmas eve and on any other
evening in the year is that little piles of queer shaped
envelopes seem to be lying about, while there is
quite a lot of tissue paper and string to be seen peeping
from odd corners. The electric light is reduced to one
bulb, but when the maid opens the door showing in</i>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I daresay they believed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come immediately to tell
you of my decision&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps this trouble will then be a
little more off my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't think the matter out

are quite safe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you and your father&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you,
whom he baptised&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should have robbed him! I never

she never got on with your father.</p>

knows too, does she?</p>

This is an unfortunate time for the storm to break on him.

it can't be helped&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>and he sets his teeth</i>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with touching solemnity.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
think I could not bear to see the family I have loved brought
to such disgrace.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you'll compound my felony?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>a little nervous.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's only
your joke!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll come to no harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary. And I want to
ask your pardon, Edward, for some of the hard thoughts I
have had of you. I consider this effort of yours to restore
to the firm the credit which your father lost a very striking
one. What improvements have you effected so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>wondering what is coming now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the
money that my father left&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I suppose you take the
ordinary profits of the firm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It costs me very little to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you restore to the clients all
round in proportion to the amount they have lost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>cautiously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you think that's quite
fair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I consider the treachery to
have been blacker in some cases than in others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his face brightening a little.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you going
to help me in this work of mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely by consenting not to prosecute
I am doing so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you do no more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as far as my own money is
concerned, this is my proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he coughs and proceeds
very formally.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering how absolutely I trusted
your father and believed in him, I think you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
at once return me the balance of my capital that there
is left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>cold again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is being done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mr. george booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good. That you should continue
to pay me a fair interest upon the rest of that capital,
which ought to exist and does not. And that you should,
year by year, pay me back by degrees out of the earnings
of the firm as much of that capital as you can afford. We
will agree upon the sum&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say a thousand a year. I
doubt if you can ever restore me all that I have lost, but
do your best and I shan't complain. There&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think
that is fair dealing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">honor.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought, dear Mr. Booth, perhaps you
wouldn't mind carrying round this basket of things yourself.
It's so very damp underfoot that I don't want to
send one of the maids out to-night if I can possibly avoid
it&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if one doesn't get Christmas presents the very

All useful presents. And that's something for you but
you're not to look at it till the morning.</p>

advice about. But upon this&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do let me know better.
Hugh and I will be happier apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>obstinately.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with resolute patience, having vented a
little sigh.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hugh finds that my opinions distress him.
And I have at last lost patience with Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>who has been trying to follow this
through her spectacles.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does Beatrice say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>translating into a loud sing-song.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
she wishes to leave her husband because she has lost
patience!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. voysey.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with considerable acrimony.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you
must be a very ill-tempered woman. Hugh has a sweet
nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>shouting self-consciously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonsense, mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>shouting good-humouredly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite agree
with you, mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>she continues to her husband in an even
just tone.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a sweet nature, Hugh, and it is most
difficult to get angry with you. I have been seven years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
working up to it. But now that I am angry, I shall never
get pleased again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has he failed in his duty? Tell us. I'm
not bigoted in his favour. I know your faults, Hugh.</p>

alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd state my case against Hugh, if I thought
he'd retaliate.</p>

art to make money.</p>

metaphors of that sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>reasonably.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I think Hugh ought to
earn more money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>quite pleased to be getting along at last.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,
why doesn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't say you don't want money any more

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know I never considered Art a very good
profession for you, Hugh. And you won't even stick to
one department of it. It's a profession that gets people
into very bad habits, I consider. Couldn't you take up
something else? You could still do those wood-cuts in
your spare time to amuse yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would matter to me. There speaks the artist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a right to be arrogant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good workmen are humble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own opinion is, Beatrice and Hugh, that
you don't realise the meaning of the word marriage. I
don't call myself a religious man&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but dash it all, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
were married in church!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And you then entered upon
an awful compact!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Surely&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a woman, Beatrice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the religious point of it ought to appeal to you. Good
Lord, suppose everybody were to carry on like this! And
have you considered, Beatrice, that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whether you're
right or whether you're wrong&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you desert Hugh, you
cut yourself off from the Family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with the sweetest of smiles.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will
distress me terribly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to Heaven I'd ever been able to cut myself
off from the family! Look at Trenchard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>gobbling a little at this unexpected attack.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
do not forgive Trenchard for quarreling with and deserting
our father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trenchard quarreled because that was his only
way of escape.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Escape from what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From tyranny!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from hypocrisy!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from

<blockquote><p><i>But</i> <span class="smcap">hugh</span> <i>isn't to be stopped now</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are we all dull, cubbish, uneducated,

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>taking this as very personal.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cubbish!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Because it's the middle-class ideal that you
should respect your parents&nbsp;.&nbsp;. live with them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think
with them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. grow like them. Natural affection and
gratitude! That's what's expected, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>not to be obliterated.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly.</p>

be sure that their gratitude will be most disinterested, and
affection very natural. If your father's a drunkard or
poor; then perhaps you get free and can form an opinion
or two of your own&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and can love him or hate him as
he deserves. But our father and mother were models.
They did their duty by us&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and taught us ours.
Trenchard escaped, as I say. You took to the Army&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
so of course you've never discovered how behind the times
you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>the Major is stupent.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to express myself

at home. Everyone loves her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with fierce sarcasm.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what do we call
her? Mother's right hand! I wonder they bothered to
give her a name. By the time little Ethel came they
were tired of training children&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his voice loses its sting;

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And may I ask what we're discussing now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Edward. I knew how to get the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>

[<i>he glances most uneasily towards the door and drops his

wisely did what we all felt to be your duty. I'm sure we all
hope you have succeeded in your endeavours. But the
least we can do now in respect to our poor father's
memory is to bury the matter in&mdash;in decent oblivion. And
please&nbsp;.&nbsp;. please don't talk of prison. I thought you'd
given up that idea long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>having dismissed that

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beatrice and I mean to separate. And nothing
you may say will prevent us. The only difficulty in the
way is money. Can we command enough to live apart
comfortably?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we can't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>speaking with bewilderment.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what in
Heaven's name have we been discussing it for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">hugh.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't discussed it! I don't want to discuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
it! Why can't you mind your own business? Now I'll go
back to the billiard room and my book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>commenting calmly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Hugh was
a spoilt child. They grow to hate their parents sooner

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How few women marry with their eyes open!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">booth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have never made the best of Hugh.</p>

and cries of bravo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is out of my book&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the next
one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>she takes up her work again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
without wishing to open up Painful Streets&nbsp;.&nbsp;. however
scandalous it has been, your father left you a man's work to
do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his face cloudy.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outlaw's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>whimsical, after a moment.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meant that.
At all events you've not had to be your father's right arm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or the instrument of justice&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or a representative of the
people&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or anything second hand of that sort, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with sudden excitement.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know
what I discovered the other day about [<i>he nods at the
portrait.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>enquiring calmly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Innocence or guilt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saved his firm once&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that was true. A
most capable piece of heroism. Then, fifteen years afterwards
.&nbsp;. he started again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>greatly interested.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can't believe it was merely through
weakness&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with artistic enthusiasm.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
He was a great financier&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a man of imagination. He
had to find scope for his abilities or die. He despised these
fat little clients living so snugly on their unearned incomes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and put them and their money to the best use he could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>shaking his head solemnly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all a
fine phrase for robbery.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">beatrice</span> <i>turns her clever face to him and begins to
follow up her subject keenly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Edward&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I understand you've
been robbing your rich clients for the benefit of the poor
ones?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>who hasn't missed a word.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>gently.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we're all a bit in debt
to the poor, aren't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite so. And you don't possess and your
father didn't possess that innate sense of the sacredness of
property&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>she enjoys that phrase.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which alone can
make a truly honest man. Nor did the man possess it who
picked my pocket last Friday week&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nor does the tax-gatherer
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nor do I. Your father's freedom from
prejudice was tempered by a taste for Power and Display.
Yours is by Charity. But that's all the difference I'll
admit between you. Robbery!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's a beautiful word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>a little pained by as much of this as he
takes to be serious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he might have told me the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he didn't know it! Would you have
believed him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not. But I loved him.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">beatrice</span> <i>looks again at the gentle, earnest face</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After as well as before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. And not from mere force of habit
either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">beatrice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with reverence in her voice now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
should silence a bench of judges. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay and speak to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to. Something more serious has
happened since dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad you can see that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with sudden exultation.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The smash has
come&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and not by my fault. Old George Booth&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he been here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine it? That old man forced me
into telling him the truth. I told him to take what money
of his there was, and prosecute. He won't prosecute, but
he bargains to take the money&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and further to bleed us,
sovereign by sovereign, as I earn sovereign by sovereign
with the sweat of my soul. I'll see him in his Christian
Heaven first&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the Jew!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>keeping her head.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't reason with
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thinks he has the whip hand and he
means to use it. Also the Vicar has been told&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who
has told his wife. She knows how not to keep a secret.
The smash has come at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you're glad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankful. My conscience is clear. I've
done my best.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then as usual with him, his fervour
collapses.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh, Alice&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has it been worth doing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>encouragingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a dozen people pulled
out of the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only that isn't found out! I've bungled
this job, Alice. I feared all along I should. It was work
for a strong man&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work for a patient man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You use kind words. But I've never
shirked the truth about myself. My father said mine was
a weak nature. He knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a religious nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>surprised.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>proceeding to explain.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore you're not
fond of creeds and ceremonies. Therefore&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as the good
things of this wordly world don't satisfy you, you shirk
contact with it all you can. I understand this temptation
to neglect and despise practical things. But if one yields
to it one's character narrows and cheapens. That's a
pity&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but it's so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>his eyes far away.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you ever feel that
there aren't enough windows in a house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>prosaically.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this weather&nbsp;.&nbsp;. too many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well then&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a house&mdash;especially in a big
city&mdash;in my office at work, then&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one is out of hearing
of all the music of the world. And when one does get back
to Nature, instead of being all curves to her roundness, one
is all corners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>smiling at him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you love to think idly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
just as Hugh does. You do it quite well, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>then
briskly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, may I scold you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of that. You're grown to be a sloven
lately&nbsp;.&nbsp;. deliberately letting yourself be unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is happiness under one's control?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend, you shouldn't neglect your happiness
any more than you neglect to wash your face. Here has
the squalour of your work been making you poor. Because
it was liable to be stopped at any moment uncompleted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
why should that let your life be incomplete? Edward, for
the last eighteen months you've been more like a moral
portent than a man. You've not had a smile to throw to
a friend&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or an opinion upon any subject. You've
dropped your Volunteering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he protests.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
something comic in volunteering&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though Heaven knows
what it is! I suppose you found it out of keeping with
your unhappy fate. And how slack you were in your
politics last November. I don't believe you even voted&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>contrite at this.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was wrong of me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I expect a man to be a good citizen. And
you don't even eat properly.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>With that she completes the accusation and</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span>
<i>searches round for a defence</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice, it was always an effort with me to do
all those things&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and lately every effort has had to go to
my work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't laugh at me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>whispering the awful words.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then truthfully,
Edward, once upon a time you were a bit of a prig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with enough sense of humour to whisper
back.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid so! But the prig fell ill when your
father died&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and had to be buried in his grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Then
her voice rises stirringly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, don't you see what a blessing
this cursed work was meant to be to you? Why must you
stand stiff against it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>without a smile now.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But lately, Alice, I've
hardly known myself. Once or twice I've lost my temper&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I've been brutal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the best news in the world. There's
your own wicked nature coming out. That's what we've
been waiting for&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's what we want. That's you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>still serious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Edward, be a little proud of poor humanity
.&nbsp;. take your own share in it gladly. It so discourages
the rest of us if you don't.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Suddenly he breaks down completely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't let myself be glad and live. There's
the future to think of. And I'm so afraid of that. I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
pretend I don't care&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>her mocking at an end.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is it you fear
most about the future&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not just the obviously unpleasant
things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll put me in prison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who'll be the man who comes out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no! I'm a coward. I can't stand alone,
it's too lonely. I need affection&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I need friends. I
cling to people that I don't care for deeply&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just for the
comfort of it. I've no home of my own. Every house
that welcomes me now I like to think of as something of a
home. And I know that this disgrace in store will leave
me for a long time or a short time&nbsp;.&nbsp;. homeless.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There he sits shaken.</i> <span class="smcap">alice</span> <i>waits a moment, not
taking her eyes from him; then speaks</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's something else I want to scold you for.
You've still given up proposing to me. Certainly that
shows a lack of courage&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and of perseverance. Or is it
the loss of what I always considered a very laudable
ambition?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>is hardly able to trust his ears. Then he
looks into her face and his thankfulness frames

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Edward.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>For a minute he just holds his breath with happiness.
But he shakes himself free of it, almost
savagely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, we mustn't be stupid. I'm
sorry I asked for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with serene strength.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad that you want
me. While I live&nbsp;.&nbsp;. where I am will be Home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>struggling with himself.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's too late.
If you'd said Yes before I came into my inheritance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
perhaps I shouldn't have given myself to the work. So be
glad that it's too late. I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>happily.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never any chance of my
marrying you when you were only a well-principled prig.
I didn't want you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I don't believe you really
wanted me. Now you do. And you must always take
what you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>turning to her again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear, what
have we to start life upon&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to build our house upon?
Poverty&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and prison for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>mischievous.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward, you seem to think
that all the money in the world was invested in your
precious firm. I have four hundred a year of my own. At
least let that tempt you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>catches her in his arms with a momentary
little burst of passion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're tempting me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She did not resist, but nevertheless he breaks away
from her, disappointed with himself. She goes
on, quietly, serenely.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I? Am I playing upon your senses in any
way? Am I a silly child looking to you for protection in
return for your favour? Shall I hinder or help your life?
If you don't think me your equal as woman to man, we'll
never speak of this again. But if you do&nbsp;.&nbsp;. look at me
and make your choice. To refuse me my work and
happiness in life and to cripple your own nature&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or to
take my hand.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>She puts out her hand frankly, as a friend should.
With only a second's thought he, happy too now, takes
it as frankly. Then she sits beside him and quite
cheerfully changes the subject.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, referring to the subject of Mr. George
Booth. What will he do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>responsive though impatient.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll do
nothing. I shall be before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about his proposal?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That needs no answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it does. I know the temptation to hit back
at him mock-heroically&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's natural. Well, we'll
consider it done. But he's a silly old man and he doesn't
know what he's talking about. I think we can bargain
with him to keep the firm going somehow&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if we
can we must.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this</i> <span class="smcap">edward</span> <i>makes a last attempt to abandon
himself to his troubles</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Alice, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;. let it end here. It has done
for me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm broken. And of course we can't be married
.&nbsp;. that's absurd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with firmness enough for two.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall be
married. And nothing's broken&nbsp;.&nbsp;. except our pride and
righteousness&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and several other things we're better
without. And now we must break our dignity in to
bargaining.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>struggling in the toils of virtue.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it'll
be so useless. Colpus'll be round in a day or two to make
his conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he'll tell some intimate friend. They'll
all come after their money like wasps after honey. And
if they know I won't lift a finger in my own defence&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
what sort of mercy will they have?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>triumphantly completing her case.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Edward,
if you surrender yourself entirely, you'll find them
powerless against you. You see, you had something to
hope or fear from Mr. Booth&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you hoped in your heart
he'd end your trouble. But when you've conquered that
last little atom of the selfishness which gets in one's way, I
think you'll find you can do what you wish with these
selfish men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>and she adds fervently.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it's a power so
seldom used. But the man who is able, and cares deeply,
and yet has nothing to hope or fear is all powerful&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even
in little things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will nothing ever happen to set me free?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Shall I never be able to rest for a moment&nbsp;.&nbsp;. turn round
and say I've succeeded or I've failed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That isn't what matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they could all meet and agree, they might
syndicate themselves and keep me at it for life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more could you wish for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that dreary round!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear, the world must be put tidy. That's
the work which splendid criminals&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and others leave
about for us poor commonplace people to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>with a little laugh.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don't believe
in Heaven either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>close to him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there's to be our life.
What's wrong with that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear, when they put me in prison for
swindling&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>he makes the word sound its worst.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they won't. But if they are so stupid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I must be very careful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">alice.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid false pride. I shall be foolishly
proud of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">edward.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's good to be praised sometimes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by
you.</p>

<p>At Shapters, <span class="smcap">george farrant's</span> house in Hertfordshire.
Ten o'clock on a Sunday evening in summer.</p>

<p class="direct1"><i>Facing you at her piano by the window, from which she
is protected by a little screen, sits</i> <span class="smcap">mrs. farrant</span>;
<i>a woman of the interesting age, clear-eyed and all
her face serene, except for a little pucker of the brows
which shows a puzzled mind upon some important
matters. To become almost an ideal hostess has been
her achievement; and in her own home, as now, this
grace is written upon every movement. Her eyes
pass over the head of a girl, sitting in a low chair by
a little table, with the shaded lamplight falling on her
face. This is</i> <span class="smcap">lucy davenport</span>; <i>twenty-three, undefeated
in anything as yet and so unsoftened. The
book on her lap is closed, for she has been listening
to the music. It is possibly some German philosopher,
whom she reads with a critical appreciation of
his shortcomings. On the sofa near her lounges</i>
<span class="smcap">mrs. o'connell</span>; <i>a charming woman, if by charming
you understand a woman who converts every quality
she possesses into a means of attraction, and has no use
for any others. On the sofa opposite sits</i> <span class="smcap">miss trebell</span>.
<i>In a few years, when her hair is quite grey,
she will assume as by right the dignity of an old maid.
Between these two in a low armchair is</i> <span class="smcap">lady davenport</span>.
<i>She has attained to many dignities.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> <i>Mother
and grandmother, she has brought into the world
and nourished not merely life but character. A
wonderful face she has, full of proud memories and
fearless of the future. Behind her, on a sofa between
the windows, is</i> <span class="smcap">walter kent</span>. <i>He is just what
the average English father would like his son to be.
You can see the light shooting out through the
windows and mixing with moonshine upon a
smooth lawn. On your left is a door. There are
many books in the room, hardly any pictures, a
statuette perhaps. The owner evidently sets beauty
of form before beauty of colour. It is a woman's
room and it has a certain delicate austerity. By the
time you have observed everything</i>, <span class="smcap">mrs. farrant</span>
<i>has played Chopin's prelude opus 28, number 20
from beginning to end</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, my dear Julia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Protesting.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't play for a moment longer than
I feel musical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">miss trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it right, Julia, to finish
with that after an hour's Bach?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suddenly came over Chopinesque,
Fanny;&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what's your objection?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>as she sits by her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell</span>. What&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when Bach has raised
me to the heights of unselfishness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Grimacing sweetly, her eyes only
half lifted.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he? I'm glad that I don't understand
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Putting mere prettiness in its
place.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One may prefer Chopin when one is young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is that a reproach or a compliment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Boldly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span> Or a man may&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unless he's a
philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>To the rescue.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Trebell,
you're very hard on mere humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Completing the reproof.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's
my wretched training as a schoolmistress, Lady Davenport
.&nbsp;. one grew to fear it above all things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Throwing in the monosyllable
with sharp youthful enquiry.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no text books on the
subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Smiling at her friend.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Fanny&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I think you escaped to look after your brother only just
in time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another year I might have been
head-mistress, which commits you to approve of the
system for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shaking her wise head.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've
watched the Education fever take England&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I hadn't stopped teaching things
I didn't understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not without mischief.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what
was the effect on the pupils?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell you that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frances never taught you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I wish she had. But I was at
her sort of a school before I went to Newnham. I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Very distastefully.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up-to-date, it
was described as.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was like a merry-go-round
at top speed. You felt things wouldn't look a bit like that
when you came to a standstill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they don't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With great decision.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a
bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>In her velvet tone.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was taught
the whole duty of woman by a parson-uncle who disbelieved
in his Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a man at Jude's was going to
take orders&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jude's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Oxford. The dons went very
gingerly with him over bits of science and history.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>This wakes a fruitful thought in</i> <span class="smcap">julia farrant</span>'s
<i>brain</i>.]</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma, have you ever discussed so-called
anti-Christian science with Lord Charles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cantelupe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It was over appointing a teacher
for the schools down here&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he was staying with us. The
Vicar's his fervent disciple. However, we were consulted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn't Lord Charles want you to
send the boys there till they were ready for Harrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the last thing in Toryism!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma made George say we were
too <i>nouveau riche</i> to risk it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>As she laughs.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't resist that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Catching something of her subject's
dry driving manner.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord Charles takes the superior
line and says&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that with his consent the Church may
teach the unalterable Truth in scientific language or
legendary, whichever is easier understanded of the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the prospect of Disestablishment
suddenly makes him so accommodating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With large contempt.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He needn't
be. The majority of people believe the world was made
in an English week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Bishop dare deny it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>From the heights of experience.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear
Lucy, do you seriously think that the English spirit&mdash;the
nerve that runs down the backbone&mdash;is disturbed by new
theology&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or new anything?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Enjoying her epigram.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a
waste of persecution history shows us!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">walter kent</span> <i>now captures the conversation with a
very young politician's fervour</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they're disestablished they must
make up their minds what they do believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presume Lord Charles thinks
it'll hand the Church over to him and his&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dare I say
'Sect'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won't it? He knows what he wants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Subtly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the election to come
yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now both parties are pledged to a
bill of some sort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political prophecies have a knack of
not coming true; but, d'you know, Cyril Horsham warned
me to watch this position developing&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nearly four years
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on the opposition bench
sharpens the eye-sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Ironically.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he been pleased with
the prospect?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With perfect diplomacy.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the
Church must be disestablished&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better done by its
friends than its enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I don't gather he's pleased
with his dear cousin Charles's conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shrugging.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, lately, Lord Charles
has never concealed his tactics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that speech at Leeds was the
crowning move I suppose; just asking the Nonconformists
to bring things to a head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Judicially.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that was precipitate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Giving them</i> <span class="smcap">lord charles's</span> <i>oratory</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Gentlemen, in these latter days of Radical opportunism!&mdash;You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
know, I was there&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sitting next to an old gentleman
who shouted "Jesuit."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But supposing Mallaby and the
Nonconformists hadn't been able to force the Liberals'
hand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Speaking as of inferior beings.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Why, they were glad of any cry going to the Country!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>As she considers this.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
and Lord Charles would still have had as good a chance of
forcing Lord Horsham's. It has been clever tactics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Who has been listening, sharp-eyed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Contrariwise, he wouldn't have liked a Radical Bill
though, would he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With aplomb.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew he was safe
from that. The government must have dissolved before
Christmas anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the swing of the pendulum's a
sure thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With her smile.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's never a sure
thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, Mrs. Farrant, look how unpopular
the Liberals are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made them bring in Resolutions?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Overflowing with knowledge of the
subject.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told Mallaby insisted on their showing
they meant business. I thought he was being too clever
.&nbsp;. and it turns out he was. Tommy Luxmore told
me there was a fearful row in the Cabinet about it.
But on their last legs, you know, it didn't seem to matter,
I suppose. Even then, if Prothero had mustered up an
ounce of tact&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe they could have pulled them
through&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the Spoliation one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr. Trebell dished that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry says his speech didn't
turn a vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With charming irony.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How disinterested
of him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Enthusiastic.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That speech did if ever
a speech did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any record of a speech that
ever did? He just carried his own little following with
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the crux of the whole matter is
and has always been&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what's to be done with the
Church's money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Visualising sovereigns.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hundred
millions or so&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been from the start a
good deal of anti-Nonconformist feeling against applying
the money to secular uses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Deprecating false modesty, on anyone's
behalf.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, of course the speech turned votes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. twenty
of them at least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Determined on information.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
I was told Lord Horsham had tried to come to an understanding
himself with the Nonconformists about Disestablishment&mdash;oh&mdash;a
long time ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;. over the Education
Bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that true, Julia?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should I know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With some mischief.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Weighing her words.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think
it would have been altogether wise to make advances.
They'd have asked more than a Conservative government
could possibly persuade the Church to give up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see that Horsham's much better
off now. He only turned the Radicals out on the Spoliation
question by the help of Trebell. And so far&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
mean, till this election is over Trebell counts still as one of
them, doesn't he, Miss Trebell? Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps he
doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll tell you he never has counted
as one of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt Lord Charles would sooner
have done without his help. And that's why I didn't ask
the gentle Jesuit this week-end if anyone wants to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Stupent at this lack of party spirit.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he'd rather have had the Liberals go to the
country undefeated!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With finesse.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election may
bring us back independent of Mr. Trebell and anything
he stands for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">walter kent.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sharply.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you asked Lord
Horsham to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With still more finesse.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had my
reasons. Votes aren't everything.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">lady davenport</span><i>has been listening with rather a
doubtful smile; she now caps the discussion</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm relieved to hear you say so, my
dear Julia. On the other hand democracy seems to have
brought itself to a pretty pass. Here's a measure, which
the country as a whole neither demands nor approves
of, will certainly be carried, you tell me, because a minority
on each side is determined it shall be&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for totally
different reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">mrs. farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shrugging again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't our business
to prevent popular government looking foolish,
Mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lady davenport.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that Tory cynicism or feminine?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this moment</i> <span class="smcap">george farrant</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>comes through
the window; a good-natured man of forty-five. He

experience; ranging from the management of an
estate which he inherited at twenty-four, through
the chairmanship of a newspaper syndicate, through</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>

was a subject that compromised nobody.</p>

frankly flabbergasted at the publicity of this
intrigue.</p>

Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we've had some very interesting talks since. And

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why offensive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may flirt. Making love's another

the difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Provokingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I doubt if I'm interested

Not flirtation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With an air of self-revelation.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
don't know. To keep one's place in the world, I suppose,
one's self-respect and a sense of humour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that difficult?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get what I want, without paying

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to flirt with life generally. Now,
what made your husband marry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Dealing with the impertinence in her

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Appealing to him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to live
at Linaskea and have as many children as God sent,
I should manage to make Justin pretty miserable!
And what would be left of me at all I should like to
know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Justin lives at Linaskea alone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm told now there's a pretty housemaid&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>she

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he drink too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no. You'd like Justin, I daresay.
He's clever. The thirteenth century's what he knows
about. He has done a book on its statutes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. has been
doing another.</p>

capacity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if that's not an end in itself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
[<i>With a touch of romantic piety.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose there's the

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Grimly material.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, more developing!

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both minded. But I had ideals of
womanhood that I wouldn't sacrifice to any human being.
Then I fell in with a woman who seduced me, and for a
whole year led me the life of a French novel&nbsp;.&nbsp;. played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
about with my emotion as I had tortured that other poor
girl's brains. Education you'd call it in the one case as I
called it in the other. What a waste of time!</p>

contempt.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get that far more easily than a
woman. That's one of my grudges against men. Why
can't women take love-affairs so lightly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are reasons. But make a good
beginning with this one. Kiss me at once.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He leans towards her. She considers him quite

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Accepting the postponement in a business-like

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Confessing engagingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made up
my mind to bring you within arms' length of me when we'd
met at Lady Percival's. Do you remember?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>His face
shows no sign of it.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the day after your speech on
the Budget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I remember. But I haven't observed
the process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Subtly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your sister grew to like me
very soon. That's all the cunning there has been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is just mutual attraction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And opportunities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some spiritual need or other, I suppose,
which makes me risk unhappiness&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in fact, welcome
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With great briskness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your present need
is a good shaking&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I seriously mean that. You get to
attach importance to these shades of emotion. A slight
physical shock would settle them all. That's why I asked
you to kiss me just now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven't very nice ideas, have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three facts in life that call up
emotion&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Birth, Death, and the Desire for Children.
The niceties are shams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why do you want to kiss me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;.&nbsp;. seriously. But I shall in a
minute just to finish the argument. Too much diplomacy
always ends in a fight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I don't fight&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it'd be no
fun for you, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would get that much good out of me.
For it's my point of honour&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to leave nothing I touch as
I find it.</p>

besides a double door; when it is opened another door
is seen. When that is opened you discover a writing
table, and beyond can discern a book-case filled with
heavy volumes&mdash;law reports perhaps. The little
room beyond is, so to speak, an under-study. Between
the two rooms a window, again barely curtained,
throws light down the staircase. But in the
big room, while the books are many the choice of
them is catholic; and the book-cases are low, running
along the wall. There is an armchair before the
bright fire, which is on your right. There is a sofa.
And in the middle of the room is an enormous
double writing table piled tidily with much appropriate
impedimenta, blue books and pamphlets and with
an especial heap of unopened letters and parcels.
At the table sits</i> <span class="smcap">trebell</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>himself, in good health
and spirits, but eyeing askance the work to which he

him. She is dressed to go out and has a housekeeping

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you busy, Henry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More or less. Come in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll dine at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julia Farrant and Lucy have run up to
town, I think. I thought of going round and asking
them to come in&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but perhaps your young man will
be going there. Amy O'Connell said something vague
about our going to Charles Street&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she may be out
of town by now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'll be in anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Going to the window as she buttons her
gloves.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you on deck early this morning? It must
have been lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I turned in before we got out of le Havre.
I left Kent on deck and found him there at six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think autumn means to come at all
this year&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it'll be winter one morning. September
has been like a hive of bees, busy and drowsy. By the way,
Cousin Mary has another baby&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Indifferent to the information.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's the
fourth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth. They asked me down for the
christening&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I really couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September's the month for Tuscany. The
car chose to break down one morning just as we were
starting North again: so we climbed one of the little hills
and sat for a couple of hours, while I composed a fifteenth
century electioneering speech to the citizens of Siena.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With a half smile.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you a vein of
romance for holiday time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Dispersing the suggestion.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all
romantic&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing but figures and fiscal questions.

been, though you only think of its art and its murders now.</p>

or denying it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interviewer caught me at Basle. I offered
to discuss the state of the Swiss navy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that before Lord Horsham wrote to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, his letter came to Innsbruck. He
"expressed" it somehow. Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it isn't known that
he will definitely ask me to join?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whitehall had a leader before the
Elections were well over to say that he must&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but, of
course, that was Mr. Farrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Knowingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Farrant. I saw it in

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must, I think. It's over a month

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>His thoughts running quickly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There'll

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, it's about Percival I want you.

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Pinked.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's a good answer.
How does he stomach me in prospect as a colleague, so far?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, professional etiquette forbids me
to disclose what a patient may confess in the sweat of
his agony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll be Chancellor again and lead the
House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not? He only grumbles that he's
getting old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Thinking busily again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty is I
shall have to stay through one budget with them. He'll
have a surplus&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it looks like it&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my only
way of agreeing with him will be to collar it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good heavens!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you'll have a
hundred million or so to give away when you've disendowed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to give away. I'll sell every penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With an incredulous grin.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're
not going back to extending old-age pensions after turning
the unfortunate Liberals out on it, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no&nbsp;.&nbsp;. none of your half crown measures.
They can wait to round off their solution of that till they've
the courage to make one big bite of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shan't see the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Lifting the subject off its feet.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not if I
come out of the cabinet and preach revolution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or will they make a Tory of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Acknowledging that stroke with a return grin.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It'll be said they have when the bill is out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's said so already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows a radical bill when he sees it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not pleased you have to be running
a tilt against the party system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He becomes a little
dubious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's a nasty windmill. Oh,
you've not seen that article in the Nation on Politics and
Society&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's written at Mrs. Farrant and Lady Lurgashall
and that set. They hint that the Tories would never
have had you if it hadn't been for this bad habit of opposite
party men meeting each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Unimpressed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent habit! What we
really want in this country is a coalition of all the shibboleths
with the rest of us in opposition&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for five years
only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Smiling generously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it's a sensation
to see you become arbiter. The Tories are owning
they can't do without you. Percival likes you personally
.&nbsp;. Townsend don't matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cantelupe you buy
with a price, I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Farrant you can put in your
pocket. I tell you I think the man you may run up against
is Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, all he wants is to be let look big&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
to have an idea given him when he's going to make a
speech, which isn't often.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now I may
go down to history as having been in your confidence.
I'm very glad you've arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With great seriousness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've sharpened
myself as a weapon to this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Kindly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you're sure of yourself,
aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Turning his wrist.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Slipping his doctor's fingers over the
the pulse.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy, I should say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I promise you it hasn't varied a beat these
three big months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I wish it had. Perfect balance
is most easily lost. How do you know you've the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
recovery?&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it's that gets one up in the morning
day by day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it? My brain works steadily on&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hasn't
failed me yet. I keep it well fed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He breathes deeply.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But I'm not sure one shouldn't have been away from England
for five years instead of five weeks&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to come back
to a job like this with a fresh mind. D'you know why
really I went back on the Liberals over this question?
Not because they wanted the church money for their pensions
.&nbsp;. but because all they can see in Disestablishment is
destruction. Any fool can destroy! I'm not going to let a
power like the Church get loose from the State. A thirteen
hundred years' tradition of service&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all they can
think of is to cut it adrift!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Church is moribund.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yes, of course you do&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you sentimental
agnostic anarchist. Nonsense! The supernatural's a bit
blown upon&nbsp;.&nbsp;. till we re-discover what it means. But
it's not essential. Nor is the Christian doctrine. Put a
Jesuit in a corner and shut the door and he'll own that.
No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the tradition of self-sacrifice and fellowship in
service for its own sake&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's the spirit we've to capture
and keep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Really struck.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A secular Church!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With reasoning in his tone.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why
not? Listen here. In drafting an act of Parliament one
must alternately imagine oneself God Almighty and the
most ignorant prejudiced little blighter who will be
affected by what's passed. God says: Let's have done
with Heaven and Hell&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's the Earth that shan't pass
away. Why not turn all those theology mongers into
doctors or schoolmasters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to doctors&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite so, you naturally prejudiced blighter.
That priestcraft don't need re-inforcing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It needs recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What! It's the only thing most people
believe in. Talk about superstition! However, there's
more life in you. Therefore it's to be schoolmasters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen again, young man. In the youth of
the world, when priests were the teachers of men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not to be preached at.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And physicians
of men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shut up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there's any real reform going, I want
my profession made into a state department. I won't
shut up for less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Putting this aside with one finger.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll
deal with you later. There's still Youth in the world in
another sense; but the priests haven't found out the

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious education won't do now-a-days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's Now-a-days? You're very dull, Gilbert.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not duller than the people who will
have to understand your scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They won't understand it. I shan't explain
to them that education is religion, and that those who
deal in it are priests without any laying on of hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what they teach?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the matter is how they teach it. I
see schools in the future, Gilbert, not built next to the
church, but on the site of the church.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think the world is grown up
enough to do without dogma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and am I to write my prescriptions

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord save us! I never thought to find
you a visionary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't it absurd to think that in a hundred
years we shall be giving our best brains and the price of
them not to training grown men into the discipline of destruction
.&nbsp;. not even to curing the ills which we might
be preventing&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but to teaching our children. There's
nothing else to be done&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing else matters. But
it's work for a priesthood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Affected; not quite convinced.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you
think you can buy a tradition and transmute it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't mock at money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you speak of it as an end not as a means.
That's unfair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speaks as I finds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll buy the Church, not with money, but
with the promise of new life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>A certain rather gleeful
cunning comes over him.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It'll only look like a dose of
reaction at first&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sectarian Training Colleges endowed
to the hilt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What'll the Nonconformists say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bribe them with the means of equal efficiency.
The crux of the whole matter will be in the
statutes I'll force on those colleges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'll want dogma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dogma's not a bad thing if you've power to
adapt it occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of spending your brains in
explaining it. Yes, I agree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With full voice.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the creed I'll
lay down as unalterable there shall be neither Jew nor
Greek&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What do you think of St. Paul, Gilbert?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd make him the head of a college.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll make the Devil himself head of a college,
if he'll undertake to teach honestly all he knows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he'll conjure up Comte and Robespierre
for you to assist in this little <i>rechauff&eacute;e</i> of their
schemes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hullo! Comte I knew about. Have I
stolen from Robespierre too?</p>

Property to him who can make the best use of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what we must do is to give the
children power over their teachers?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Now he is comically enigmatic.</i> <span class="smcap">wedgecroft</span>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what exactly do you mean by
that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Serious again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How positive a pedagogue
would you be if you had to prove your cases and justify
your creed every century or so to the pupils who had
learnt just a little more than you could teach them? Give
power to the future, my friend&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not to the past. Give
responsibility&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even if you give it for your own discredit.
What's beneath trust deeds and last wills and
testaments, and even acts of Parliament and official creeds?
Fear of the verdict of the next generation&nbsp;.&nbsp;. fear of
looking foolish in their eyes. Ah, we&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doing our best
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;. must be ready for every sort of death. And to provide
the means of change and disregard of the past is a
secret of statesmanship. Presume that the world will
come to an end every thirty years if it's not reconstructed.
Therefore give responsibility&nbsp;.&nbsp;. give responsibility&nbsp;.&nbsp;. give
the children power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Disposed to whistle.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those statutes
will want some framing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Relapsing to a chuckle.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's an incidental
change to foresee. Disappearance of the parson

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you're here now to hand me
half the responsibility, aren't you?</p>

there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My maid sees I'm ill and worried and makes

you to tell me, Henry&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it isn't much. That night we

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Collecting himself as if to explain to a child.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I must make you understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I must get you to realise
that for a little time to come you're above the law&nbsp;.&nbsp;. above
even the shortcomings and contradictions of a man's
affection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us have one beautiful memory to share.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Determined she shall face the cold logic of her

back on a fit of drunkenness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Neither understanding nor wishing to; only

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With bitter sarcasm.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, don't say that.
Won't it comfort you to think of drunkenness as a beautiful
thing? There are precedents enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;. classic ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean I might have been any other woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Quite inexorable.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't any other
woman have served the purpose&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and is it less of a
purpose because we didn't know we had it? Does my
unworthiness then&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you like to call it so&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make you
unworthy now? I must make you see that it doesn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Petulantly hammering at her id&eacute;e fixe.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you
didn't love me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you don't love me.</p>

the last five minutes have I really taken the smallest
interest in you. And now I believe I'm half jealous. Can
you understand that? You've been talking a lot of nonsense
about your emotions and your immortal soul. Don't
you see it's only now that you've become a person of some
importance to the world&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Losing her patience, childishly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you
mean by the World? You don't seem to have any personal
feelings at all. It's horrible you should have thought of me
like that. There has been no other man than you that I
would have let come anywhere near me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not for more
than a year.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He realises that she will never understand.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear girl, I'm sorry to be brutal. Does

be the father of your child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Ungracious but pacified by his change of tone.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It doesn't matter now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Friendly still.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On principle I don't make
promises. But I think I can promise you that if you
keep your head and will keep your health, this shall all be
made as easy for you as if everyone could know. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
let's think what the child may mean to you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just the
fact of his birth. Nothing to me, of course! Perhaps
that accounts for the touch of jealousy. I've forfeited my
rights because I hadn't honourable intentions. You
can't forfeit yours. Even if you never see him and he has
to grow up among strangers&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just to have had a child
must make a difference to you. Of course, it may be a
girl. I wonder.</p>

then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">amy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wouldn't break my heart. You'd marry me,
wouldn't you? We could go away somewhere. I could be

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Alert and cautious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to endow
colleges?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under public control?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Church colleges under Church control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There'd be others?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve the necessary balance in the
schools.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not founded with church money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the grants in aid that will be released.
I must ask the Treasury for a further lump sum
and with that there may be sufficient for secular colleges&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
if you can agree with me upon the statutes of those over
which you'd otherwise have free control.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">trebell</span> <i>is weighing his words</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You" meaning, for instance&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what
authorities in the Church?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bishops, I suppose&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<span class="smcap">cantelupe</span>
<i>permits himself to smile.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that point I shall
be weakness itself and&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may I suggest&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your seat in
the cabinet will give you some control.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statutes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be framed in the best interests of educational
efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Finding an opening.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt if we agree
upon the meaning to be attached to that term.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Forcing the issue.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What meaning do you
attach to it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Smiling again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have hardly a sympathetic
listener.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an unprejudiced one&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
best you can hope for. I was not educated myself. I
learnt certain things that I desired to know&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from
reading my first book&mdash;Don Quixote it was&mdash;to mastering
Company Law. You see, as a man without formulas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
either for education or religion, I am perhaps peculiarly
fitted to settle the double question. I have no grudges&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
no revenge to take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Suddenly congenial.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelton's translation
of Don Quixote I hope&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the modern ones have no
flavour. And you took all the adventures as seriously as
the Don did?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not expecting this.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the finer attitude&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the child's
attitude. And it would enable you immediately to comprehend
mine towards an education consisting merely of
practical knowledge. The life of Faith is still the happy
one. What is more crushingly finite than knowledge?
Moral discipline is a nation's only safety. How much of
your science tends in support of the great spiritual doctrine
of sacrifice!</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">trebell</span> <i>returns to his subject as forceful as ever</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church has assimilated much in her
time. Do you think it wise to leave agnostic science at the
side of the plate? I think, you know, that this craving for
common knowledge is a new birth in the mind of man;
and if your church won't recognise that soon, by so much
will she be losing her grip for ever over men's minds.
What's the test of godliness, but your power to receive
the new idea in whatever form it comes and give it life?
It is blasphemy to pick and choose your good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>For a
moment his thoughts seem to be elsewhere.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's an unhappy
man or woman or nation&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know it if it has
only come to me this minute&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I don't care what
their brains or their riches or their beauty or any of
their triumph may be&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they're unhappy and useless if
they can't tell life from death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Interested in the digression.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember
that the Church's claim has ever been to know that
difference.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Fastening to his subject again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
point is this: A man's demand to know the exact structure
of a fly's wing, and his assertion that it degrades any child
in the street not to know such a thing, is a religious
revival&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a token of spiritual hunger. What else can it
be? And we commercialise our teaching!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't have it so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I'm offering you the foundation of a
new Order of men and women who'll serve God by teaching
his children. Now shall we finish the conversation in
prose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not to be put down.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the prose
for God?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not to be put down either.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what we
irreligious people are giving our lives to discover.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He
plunges into detail.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm proposing to found about
seventy-two new colleges, and of course, to bring the ones
there are up to the new standard. Then we must gradually
revise all teaching salaries in government schools&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
to a scale I have in mind. Then the course must be
compulsory and the training time doubled&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubled! Four years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, a minimum of three&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a university
course. Remember we're turning a trade into a calling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's more to that than taking a degree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so. You've fought for years for
your tests and your atmosphere with plain business men
not able to understand such lunacy. Quite right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
atmosphere's all that matters. If one and one don't make
two by God's grace&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poetry again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg your pardon. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you've no
further proof. If you can't plant your thumb on the earth
and your little finger on the pole star you know nothing of
distances. We must do away with text-book teachers.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">cantelupe</span> <i>is opening out a little in spite of himself</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm waiting for our opinions to differ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Businesslike again.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll send you a draft
of the statutes I propose within a week. Meanwhile shall
I put the offer this way. If I accept your tests will you
accept mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe if one provides for efficiency one
provides for the best part of truth&nbsp;.&nbsp;. honesty of statement.
I shall hope for a little more elasticity in your dogmas than
Becket or Cranmer or Laud would have allowed. When
you've a chance to re-formulate the reasons of your faith
for the benefit of men teaching mathematics and science
and history and political economy, you won't neglect to
answer or allow for criticisms and doubts. I don't see
why&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in spite of all the evidence to the contrary&nbsp;.&nbsp;. such a
thing as progress in a definite religious faith is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress is a soiled word.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>And now he
weighs his words.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be very glad to accept on the
Church's behalf control of the teaching of teachers in these
colleges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good. I want the best men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are surprisingly inexperienced if you
think that creeds can ever become mere forms except to
those who have none.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But teaching&mdash;true teaching&mdash;is learning, and
the wish to know is going to prevail against any creed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
so I think. I wish you cared as little for the form in which
a truth is told as I do. On the whole, you see, I think I
shall manage to plant your theology in such soil this
spring that the garden will be fruitful. On the whole
I'm a believer in Churches of all sorts and their usefulness
to the State. Your present use is out-worn. Have
I found you in this the beginnings of a new one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church says: Thank you, it is a
very old one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Winding up the interview.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, for
practical politics our talk can be whittled down to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
accepting the secular solution for Primary Schools, if
you're given these colleges under such statutes as you and I
shall agree upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the country will accept.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The country will accept any measure if
there's enough money in it to bribe all parties fairly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect very little of the constancy of
my Church to her Faith, Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one belief myself. That is in
human progress&mdash;yes, progress&mdash;over many obstacles and
by many means. I have no ideals. I believe it is statesmanlike
to use all the energy you find&nbsp;.&nbsp;. turning it into
the nearest channel that points forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward to what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and my caring doesn't
matter. We do know&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if we deny it it's only to be
encouraged by contradiction&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the movement is
forward and with some gathering purpose. I'm friends
with any fellow traveller.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">cantelupe</span> <i>has been considering him very curiously.
Now he gets up to go.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to continue our talk when I've
studied your draft of the statutes. Of course the political
position is favourable to a far more comprehensive bill
than we had ever looked for&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you've the advantage
now of having held yourself very free from party ties.
In fact not only will you give us the bill we shall most
care to accept, but I don't know what other man would
give us a bill we and the other side could accept
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can let you have more Appropriation
figures by Friday. The details of the Fabrics scheme will
take a little longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way there's no such hurry. We're
not in office yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I'm building with figures I like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>

the inexactest things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Smiling to him for the first time.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
shall have you finding Faith the only solvent of all problems
some day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my mind is not afraid&nbsp;.&nbsp;. even of
the Christian religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the needs of the human
soul&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be it dressed up in whatever knowledge&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do not
alter from age to age&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

he could get on though you differed on every point; but
he didn't see how you'd pull with such a blasted weak-kneed
lot as the rest of the Horsham's cabinet would be.

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I see him?</p>

you should need instructing in the ethics of party government.

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Who has smiled very broadly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you
don't mean to&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don't stop while I tell you.</p>

children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>The words catch him and hold him. He looks

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope so.</p>

much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">lucy.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew you would be or I shouldn't have come.

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll see you down.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">lord horsham's</span> house in Queen Anne's Gate, in the
evening, a week later.</p>

<p class="direct1"><i>If rooms express their owners' character, the grey and black
of</i> <span class="smcap">lord horsham's</span> <i>drawing room, the faded brocade
of its furniture, reveal him as a man of delicate taste
and somewhat thin intellectuality. He stands now
before a noiseless fire, contemplating with a troubled
eye either the pattern of the Old French carpet, or the
black double doors of the library opposite, or the
moulding on the Adams ceiling, which the flicker of
all the candles casts into deeper relief. His grey hair
and black clothes would melt into the decoration of his
room, were the figure not rescued from such oblivion
by the British white glaze of his shirt front and&mdash;to a
sympathetic eye&mdash;by the loveable perceptive face of the
man. Sometimes he looks at the sofa in front of him,
on which sits</i> <span class="smcap">wedgecroft</span>, <i>still in the frock coat
of a busy day, depressed and irritable. With his
back to them, on a sofa with its back to them, is</i>
<span class="smcap">george farrant</span>, <i>planted with his knees apart, his
hands clasped, his head bent; very glum. And
sometimes</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>glances at the door, as if waiting
for it to open. Then his gaze will travel back, up
the long shiny black piano, with a volume of the
Well Tempered Clavichord open on its desk, to where</i>
<span class="smcap">cantelupe</span> <i>is perched uncomfortably on the bench;
paler than ever; more self-contained than ever, looking,

the ceiling or the carpet. They wait there as men
wait who have said all they want to say upon an
unpleasant subject and yet cannot dismiss it. At
last</i> <span class="smcap">farrant</span> <i>breaks the silence</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time did you ask him to come,
Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O'Connell? I didn't ask him directly.
What time did you say, Wedgecroft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time after half past ten, I told him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Grumbling.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a quarter to eleven.
Doesn't Blackborough mean to turn up at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was out of town&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my note had to be
sent after him. I couldn't wire, you see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was by the merest chance your man
caught me, Cyril. I was taking the ten fifteen to Tonbridge
and happened to go to James Street first for some
papers.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The conversation flags again.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since Mrs. O'Connell is dead what
is the excuse for a scandal?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this unpleasant dig into the subject of their
thoughts the three other men stir uncomfortably.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the inquest is unavoidable&nbsp;.&nbsp;. apparently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Suddenly letting fly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I declare I'd
have risked penal servitude and given a certificate, but
just before the end O'Connell would call in old Fielding
Andrews, who has moral scruples about everything&mdash;it's
his trademark&mdash;and of course about this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he told of the whole business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. O'Connell kept things up before
him. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the woman was dying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn't you have kept the true state of the
case from Sir Fielding?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And been suspected of the malpractice
myself if he'd found it out?&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which he would have done
.&nbsp;. he's no fool. Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought of trying that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Wedgecroft&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how grossly quixotic!
You have a duty to yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Rescuing the conversation from unpleasantness.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm afraid I feel that our position to-night is most
irregular, Wedgecroft.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still if you can make O'Connell see
reason. And if you all can't&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He frowns at the alternative.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn't you say she came to you first of all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met her one morning at Trebell's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually at Trebell's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day he came back from abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! No one seems to have noticed them
together much at any time. My wife.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No matter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tackled me as a doctor with one
part of her trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;. added she'd been with O'Connell
in Ireland, which of course it turns out wasn't true&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
asked me to help her. I had to say I couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Echoing rather than querying.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
couldn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shocked.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Horsham!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if she'd told me the truth!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No,
anyhow I couldn't. I'm sure there was no excuse. One
can't run these risks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite right, quite right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are men who do on one pretext
or another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not too shocked to be curious.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there
really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes, men well known&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in other
directions. I could give you four addresses&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but of
course I wasn't going to give her one. Though there
again&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if she'd told me the whole truth!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
women are such fools! And they prefer quackery&nbsp;.&nbsp;. look
at the decent doctors they simply turn into charlatans.
Though, there again, that all comes of letting a trade work
mysteriously under the thumb of a benighted oligarchy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
which is beside the question. But one day I'll make you
sit up on the subject of the Medical Council, Horsham.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>assumes an impenetrable air of statesmanship</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. Very interesting&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very important
.&nbsp;. very difficult to alter the status quo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the poor little liar said she'd go off
to an appointment with her dressmaker; and I heard
nothing more till she sent for me a week later, and I found
her almost too ill to speak. Even then she didn't tell me
the truth! So, when O'Connell arrived, of course I spoke
to him quite openly and all he told me in reply was that it
wouldn't have been his child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor devil!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder. Perhaps she didn't realize
he'd been sent for&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or felt then she was dying and
didn't care&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or lost her head. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a pretty little woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could have made him out and
dealt with him, of course, I shouldn't have come to you.
Farrant's known him even longer than I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was with him at Harrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I went to Farrant first.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>That part of the subject drops.</i> <span class="smcap">cantelupe</span>, <i>who
has not moved, strikes in again</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was Trebell's guilt discovered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote her one letter which she didn't
destroy. O'Connell found it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picked it up from her desk&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it
wasn't even locked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not twenty words in it&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quite enough
though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His habit of being explicit&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of writing
things down&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He shakes his head, deprecating all rashness. There
is another pause.</i> <span class="smcap">farrant</span>, <i>getting up to pace about,
breaks it</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here, Wedgecroft, one thing is worrying
me. Had Trebell any foreknowledge of what she did and
the risk she was running and could he have stopped it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Almost ill-temperedly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could he
have stopped it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, I'm not a casuist&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
I know by instinct when I'm up against the wrong thing
to do; and if he can't be cleared on that point I won't lift a
finger to save him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With nice judgment.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In using the term
Any Foreknowledge, Farrant, you may be more severe
on him than you wish to be.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">farrant</span>, <i>unappreciative, continues</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, we must admit, Cantelupe,
that if it hadn't been for the particular consequence
of this it wouldn't be anything to be so mightily shocked
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear fellow, it's our business to make
laws and we know the difference of saying in one of 'em
you may or you must. Who ever proposed to insist on
pillorying every case of spasmodic adultery? One would
never have done! Some of these attachments do more
harm&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the third party, I mean&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some less. But it's
only when a menage becomes socially impossible that a
sensible man will interfere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He adds quite unnecessarily.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm speaking quite impersonally, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>As coldly as ever.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trebell is morally
responsible for every consequence of the original sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a hard saying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Continuing his own remarks quite independently.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And I put aside the possibility that he deliberately
helped her to her death to save a scandal because I don't
believe it is a possibility. But if that were so I'd lift my
finger to help him to his. I'd see him hanged with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Settling this part of the matter.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,
Farrant, to all intents and purposes he didn't know and
he'd have stopped it if he could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I believe that. But what makes you
so sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked him and he told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's no proof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You read the letter that he sent her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
unless you think it was written as a blind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to be sure&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes. I might have
thought of that.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He settles down again. Again no one has anything
to say.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is to be said to Mr. O'Connell
when he comes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what exactly do you propose we
shall say to O'Connell, Wedgecroft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get him to open his oyster of a mind
and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is and his face like a stone wall yesterday.
Absolutely refused to discuss the matter with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask, Cyril, why are we concerning
ourselves with this wickedness at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at this moment when we have official
weight without official responsibility, Charles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could have let Percival out of
bed, but these first touches of autumn are dangerous to a
convalescent of his age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you saw him, Farrant&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he
gave you his opinion, didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose it's a pity Blackborough hasn't
turned up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never mind him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gets people to agree with him. That's a
gift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wedgecroft, what is the utmost O'Connell
will be called upon to do for us&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably only to hold his tongue at the
inquest to-morrow. As far as I know there's no one but
her maid to prove that Mrs. O'Connell didn't meet her
husband some time in the summer. He'll be called upon
to tell a lie or two by implication.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cantelupe&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what does perjury to that
extent mean to a Roman Catholic?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">cantelupe's</span> <i>face melts into an expression of mild
amazement</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your asking such a question shows that
you would not understand my answer to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Leaving the fellow to his subtleties.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,
what about the maid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">wedgecroft.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She may suspect facts but not names, I
think. Why should they question her on such a point if
O'Connell says nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's really very late. I told&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He stops.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Charles, I've forgotten that man's name again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmunds, you said it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edmunds. Everybody's down at Lympne&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I've been left with a new man here and I don't know his
name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He is very pathetic.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him to put O'Connell
in the library there. I thought that either Farrant or I
might perhaps see him first and&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this moment</i> <span class="smcap">edmunds</span> <i>comes in, and, with that
air of discreet tact which he considers befits the establishment
of a Prime Minister, announces</i>, "Mr.
O'Connell, my lord." <i>As</i> <span class="smcap">o'connell</span> <i>follows him</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>

features are so impassive that they may tell either
of the deepest grief or the purest indifference; or it
may be, merely of reticence on entering a stranger's
room. He only bows towards</i> <span class="smcap">horsham's</span> <i>half-proffered

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have sent for me, Lord Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that by my message I conveyed no
impression of sending for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always in some doubt as to by what
person or persons in or out of power this country is
governed. But from all I hear you are at the present
moment approximately entitled to send for me.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The level music of his Irish tongue seems to give

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Mr. O'Connell&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know our
request before we make it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I understand that if the fact of Mr.
Trebell's adultery with my wife were made as public as its
consequences to her must be to-morrow, public opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
would make it difficult for you to include him in your
cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore we ask you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though we have no
right to ask you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to consider the particular circumstances
and forget the man in the statesman, Mr. O'Connell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife is dead. What have I to do at all
with Mr. Trebell as a man? As a statesman I am in any
case uninterested in him.</p>

a fool. However, there's no one else to come. Once
more, Mr. O'Connell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He frames no sentence.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am all attention, Lord Horsham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. O'Connell, I remain here almost
against my will. I cannot think quite calmly about this
double and doubly heinous sin. Don't listen to us while
we make light of it. If we think of it as a political bother
and ask you to smooth it away&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am ashamed. But I
believe I may not be wrong if I put it to you that, looking
to the future and for the sake of your own Christian dignity,
it may become you to be merciful. And I pray too&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
think we may believe&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that Mr. Trebell is feeling need of
your forgiveness. I have no more to say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He sits down
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be. I have never met Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you, Mr. O'Connell, putting aside
Party, that your country has need of this man just at this
time.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>They hang upon</i> <span class="smcap">o'connell's</span> <i>reply. It comes with
deliberation</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose my point of view must be an
unusual one. I notice, at least, that twenty four hours
and more has not enabled Farrant to grasp it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God's sake, O'Connell, don't be so
cold-blooded. You have the life or death of a man's
reputation to decide on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With a cold flash of contempt.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a
petty enough thing now-a-days it seems to me. There are
so many clever men&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they are all so alike&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surely
one will not be missed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't you think that is only sarcasm, Mr.
O'Connell?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The voice is so gently reproving that</i> <span class="smcap">o'connell</span>
<i>must turn to him</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you please to make allowance, Lord
Charles, for a mediaeval scholar's contempt of modern
government? <b>You</b> at least will partly understand his
horror as a Catholic at the modern superstitions in favour
of popular opinion and control which it encourages. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
see, Lord Horsham, I am not a party man, only a little
less enthusiastic for the opposite cries than for his own.
You appealed very strangely to my feelings of patriotism
for this country; but you see even my own is&mdash;in the
twentieth century&mdash;foreign to me. From my point of
view neither Mr. Trebell, nor you, nor the men you have
just defeated, nor any discoverable man or body of men
will make laws which matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or differ in the slightest.
You are all part of your age and you all voice&mdash;though
in separate keys, or even tunes they may be&mdash;only the
greed and follies of your age. That you should do this
and nothing more is, of course, the democratic ideal. You
will forgive my thinking tenderly of the statesmanship of
the fi<b>rst</b> Edward.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The library door opens and</i> <span class="smcap">russell blackborough</span>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know Russell Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you are as far from me in your code of
personal morals as in your politics. In neither do you
seem to realise that such a thing as passion can exist. No
doubt you use the words Love and Hatred; but do you
know that love and hatred for principles or persons should
come from beyond a man? I notice you speak of forgiveness
as if it were a penny in my pocket. You have been
endeavouring for these two days to rouse me from my
indifference towards Mr. Trebell. Perhaps you are on
the point of succeeding&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I do not know what you
may rouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand. We are much in agreement,
Mr. O'Connell. What can a man be&mdash;who has any pretensions
to philosophy&mdash;but helplessly indifferent to the
thousands of his fellow creatures whose fates are intertwined
with his?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that you understand. But,
again&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have I been wrong to shrink from personal
relations with Mr. Trebell? Hatred is as sacred a responsibility
as love. And you will not agree with me when
I say that punishment can be the salvation of a man's
soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With aggressive common sense.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look here,
O'Connell, if you're indifferent it doesn't hurt you to let
him off. And if you hate him&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;! Well, one shouldn't
hate people&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there's no room for it in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Quietly as ever.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have some authority
for thinking that the punishment of a secret sin is awarded
by God secretly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have very poor authority, sir, for
using God's name merely to fill up the gaps in an argument,
though we may thus have our way easily with men who
fear God more than they know him. I am not one of
those. Yes, Farrant, you and your like have left little
room in this world except for the dusty roads on which
I notice you beginning once more to travel. The rule of
them is the same for all, is it not&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from the tramp and
the labourer to the plutocrat in his car? This is the age
of equality; and it's a fine practical equality&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
equality of the road. But you've fenced the fields of
human joy and turned the very hillsides into hoardings.
Commercial opportunity is painted on them, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not to be impressed.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is
O'Connell. My father made his money out of newspapers
and I ride in a motor car and you came from Holyhead by
train. What has all that to do with it? Why can't you
make up your mind? You know in this sort of case one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
talks a lot&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then does the usual thing. You must
let Trebell off and that's all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed. And do they still think it worth
while to administer an oath to your witnesses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a dead woman between us, Mr.
Trebell.</p>

you from the consequences of her death. What have you
to say about that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been wondering what sort of expression
the last of your care for her would find&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
My wonder is at the power over me that has been given to
something I despised.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Only</i> <span class="smcap">o'connell</span> <i>grasps his meaning. But he,

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If I wanted revenge I have it.
She was a worthless woman. First my life and now yours!
Dead because she was afraid to bear your child, isn't she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>In agony.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd have helped that if I could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">o'connell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the shame&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not the wrong she had
done me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but just fear&mdash;fear of the burden of her
woman-hood. And because of her my children are
bastards and cannot inherit my name. And I must live
in sin against my church, as&mdash;God help me&mdash;I can't
against my nature. What are men to do when this is
how women use the freedom we have given them? Is the
curse of barrenness to be nothing to a man? And that's
the death in life to which you gentlemen with your fine
civilisation are bringing us. I think we are brothers in
misfortune, Mr. Trebell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Far from responding.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all, sir. If
you wanted children you did the next best thing when she
left you. My own problem is neither so simple nor is it
yet anyone's business but my own. I apologise for
alluding to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have no choice, when Trebell

I have no personal feelings in this matter, but we may as
well face the fact even now that O'Connell holding his
tongue to-morrow won't stop gossip in the House, club
gossip, gossip in drawing rooms. What do the Radicals
really care so long as a scandal doesn't get into the papers!
There's an inner circle with its eye on us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what does that care as long as scandal's

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm inaccurate, for I'm not one of

skill I've used in making it. It wouldn't keep me at a
pinch. And Trebell&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He speaks through his teeth.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
do you think your accession to power in the party is popular
at the best? Who is going to put out a finger to make it
less awkward for Horsham to stick to you if there's a

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brains, Trebell.</p>

of a mortal sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of your lifted eyebrows at the
childishness of the word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretically, we must all wish to guide
ourselves by eternal truths. But you would admit,
wouldn't you, that we can only deal with temporal things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Writhing slightly under the sceptical

our guidance&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I admit no disbelief in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they place any time-limit to the effect
of a mortal sin? If this affair were twenty years old would
you do as you are doing? Can you forecast the opinion

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was only to make use of his opinion under

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horsham&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don't bow politely and stand
aside at this juncture as a gentleman should, because I
want to know how the work's to be done if I leave you what
I was to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we so incompetent?</p>

have in no way altered my good opinion of your proposals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I beg to remind you, Horsham,
that from the first I've reserved myself liberty to criticise
fundamental points in the scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Pacifically.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite so&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quite so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That nonsensical new standard of
teachers' salaries for one thing&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you'd never pass it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite easily. It's an administrative point,
so leave the legislation vague. Then, as the appropriation
money falls in, the qualifications rise and the salaries rise.
No one will object because no one will appreciate it but
administrators past or future&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they never cavil at
money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He remains lost in the beauty of this prospect.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you take charge of the bill, Blackborough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Brought to earth.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He corrects
himself smiling.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dear Blackborough, why
not stick to the Colonies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Trebell, there's still the
possibility that O'Connell may finally spike your gun to-morrow.
You realise that, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I quite realise that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can nothing further be done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weren't we doing our best?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if we were bending our thoughts
to that difficulty now&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Hardly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask you to interfere on
my behalf no further?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Trebell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure you that I am interested in the
Disestablishment Bill.</p>

I'll haunt you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Having said this with some finality, he
turns his back.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyril, I agree with what Trebell is saying.
Whatever happens there must be no tampering with the
comprehensiveness of the scheme. Remember you are in
the hands of the extremists&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on both sides. I won't
support a compromise on one&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nor will they on the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'll confess to you candidly, Trebell,
that I don't know of any man available for this piece of
work but you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I should say it would be almost a
relief to you if O'Connell tells on me to-morrow.</p>

We're on the subject, and it won't discount our pleasure
that you're out of this mess, to continue it. This habit of
putting off the hour of disagreement is&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, Horsham,
it's contrary to my business instincts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one time's as good as another for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>A little irritated at the wantonness of this

capable of coming to any decision&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in a technical sense.</p>

<i>gasps</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not going to pretend either now or in a
month's time that I think Trebell anything but a most
dangerous acquisition to the party. I pay you a compliment
in that, Trebell. Now, Horsham proposes that we
should go to the country when Disestablishment's through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the condition of Nonconformist support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One condition. Then you'd leave us,
Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And carry with you the credit of our

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Vigorously making his point.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
what would be the conditions of your remaining? You're
not a party man, Trebell. You haven't the true party feeling.
You are to be bought. Of course you take your
price in measures, not in money. But you are preeminently
a man of ideas&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an expert. And a man of ideas is

of all political work; believe me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Uneasily.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can form your cabinet
without me, Cyril.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>At this</i> <span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>charges down on them, so to
speak</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I tell you, I'm damned if he can.
Leaving the whole high church party to blackmail all
they can out of us and vote how they like! Here&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I've
got my Yorkshire people to think of. I can bargain for
them with you in a cabinet&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not if you've the pull
of being out of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With charming insinuation.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have
you calculated, Blackborough, what may become of us if
Trebell has the pull of being out of it?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>makes a face</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose he might turn
nasty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should hope he would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Tackling</i> <span class="smcap">farrant</span> <i>with great ease</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I should hope he would consider the matter not from the
personal, but from the political point of view&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as I am
trying to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Tasting his epigram with enjoyment.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Introspection is the only bar to such an honourable endeavour,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[<span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>gapes</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't suffer from
that as&mdash;for instance&mdash;Charles here, does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Pugnaciously.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'you mean I'm
just pretending not to attack him personally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Safe on his own ground.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's only a
curious metaphysical point. Have you never noticed
your distaste for the colour of a man's hair translate
itself ultimately into an objection to his religious opinions
.&nbsp;. or what not? I am sure&mdash;for instance&mdash;I could trace
Charles's scruples about sitting in a cabinet with Trebell
back to a sort of academic reverence for women generally
which he possesses. I am sure I could&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if he were not
probably now doing it himself. But this does not make the
scruples less real, less religious, or less political. We
must be humanly biased in expression&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or not express
ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Whose thoughts have wandered.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
man's less of a danger than he was&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I mean he'll
be alone. The Liberals won't have him back. He
smashed his following there to come over to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Giving a further meaning to this.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,
Blackborough, he did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain his own ends! Oh, my dear
Horsham, can't you see that if O'Connell had blabbed to-morrow
it really would have been a blessing in disguise? I
don't pretend to Cantelupe's standard&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but there must
be something radically wrong with a man who could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
himself into such a mess as that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now mustn't there?
Ah!&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you have a fatal partiality for clever people. I
tell you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though this might be patched up&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trebell
would fail us in some other way before we were six months
older.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>This speech has its effect; but</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>looks at him
a little sternly</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And am I to conclude that you don't want
Charles to change his mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>On another tack.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farrant has not
yet allowed us to hear Percival's opinion.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">farrant</span> <i>looks rather alarmed</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has very little reference to the scandal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that is at an end&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all the more
reason we should hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Ranging himself with</i> <span class="smcap">farrant</span>.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I called
this quite informal meeting, Blackborough, only to dispose
of the scandal, if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, of course, if Farrant chooses to
insult Percival so gratuitously by burking his message to
us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is an unspoken threat in this.</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>sees
it and without disguising his irritation</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us have it, Farrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With a sort of puzzled discontent.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I never got to telling him of the O'Connell affair at all.
He started talking to me&nbsp;.&nbsp;. saying that he couldn't for a
moment agree to Trebell's proposals for the finance of his
bill&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I couldn't get a word in edgeways. Then his wife
came up.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>takes something in this so seriously that he
actually interrupts</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he definitely disagree? What is his
point?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says Disestablishment's a bad enough
speculation for the party as it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is inevitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sees that. But then he says&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to go
to the country again having bolstered up Education and
quarrelled with everybody will be bad enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to go
having spent fifty millions on it will dish us all for our
lifetimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does he propose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll offer to draft another bill and take it
through himself. He says&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do as many good turns as we
can with the money&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don't put it all on one horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's your man, Horsham. That's
one difficulty settled.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham's</span> <i>thoughts are evidently beyond</i> <span class="smcap">blackborough</span>,
<i>beyond the absent</i> <span class="smcap">percival</span> <i>even</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;. any of us could carry that sort of a
bill.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">cantelupe</span> <i>has heard this last passage with nothing
less than horror and pale anger, which he contains
no longer</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't have this. I won't have this
opportunity frittered away for party purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Expostulating reasonably.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear
Cantelupe&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you'll get whatever you think it right for the
Church to have. You carry a solid thirty eight votes
with you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham's</span> <i>smooth voice intervenes. He speaks
with finesse.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Percival, as an old campaigner, expresses
himself very roughly. The point is, that we are after all
only the trustees of the party. If we know that a certain
step will decimate it&nbsp;.&nbsp;. clearly we have no right to take
the step.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Glowing to white heat.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a time to
count the consequences to ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Unkindly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By your action this evening,
Charles, you evidently think not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He salves the wound.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
No matter, I agree with you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the bill should be a comprehensive
one, whoever brings it in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Not without enjoyment of the situation.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Whoever brings it in will have to knuckle under to
Percival over its finance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trebell won't do that. I warned Percival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He only swore.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>suddenly becomes peevish</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Farrant, you should have given me
this message before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Horsham, what had it to do with
our request to O'Connell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Scolding the company generally.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well
then, I wish he hadn't sent it. I wish we were not discussing
these points at all. The proper time for them is at
a cabinet meeting. And when we have actually assumed
the responsibilities of government&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then threats of
resignation are not things to be played about with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you expect Percival's objection to the
finance of the scheme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps. I knew Trebell was
to see him last Tuesday. I expect everybody's objections
to any parts of every scheme to come at a time when I am
in a proper position to reconcile them&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not now.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Having vented his grievances he sits down to recover.</i>
<span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>takes advantage of the ensuing
pause</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn't so easy for me to speak against
Trebell, since he evidently dislikes me personally as much
as I dislike him&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I'm sure I'm doing my duty.
Horsham&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here you have Cantelupe who won't stand
in with the man, and Percival who won't stand in with
his measure, while I would sooner stand in with neither.
Isn't it better to face the situation now than take trouble to
form the most makeshift of Cabinets, and if that doesn't go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
to pieces, be voted down in the House by your own party?</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There is an oppressive silence.</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>is sulky.

agonies have expressed themselves in slight writhings,
at last, with an effort, writhes himself to his feet</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I am prepared to reconsider my
decision.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all right then!</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He looks round wonderingly for the rest of the chorus
to find that neither</i> <span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>nor</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span>
<i>have stirred</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Stealthily.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it, Horsham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sotto voce.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you ever make it?</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>leaves him for</i> <span class="smcap">cantelupe</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You're afraid for the integrity of
the bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be comprehensive&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's vital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Very forcefully.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you my
word to support its integrity, if you'll keep with me in
persuading Horsham that the inclusion of Trebell in his
cabinet will be a blow to the whole Conservative Cause.
Horsham, I implore you not to pursue this short-sighted
policy. All parties have made up their minds to Disestablishment
.&nbsp;. surely nothing should be easier than to
frame a bill which will please all parties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>At last perceiving the drift of all this.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
good Lord, Blackborough&nbsp;.&nbsp;. now Cantelupe has come
round and will stand in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's no longer the point. And
what's all this nonsense about going to the country again
next year?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Mildly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After consulting me Percival
said at Bristol.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Quite unchecked.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. But if
we pursue a thoroughly safe policy and the bye-elections
go right&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there need be no vote of censure carried for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
three or four years. The Radicals want a rest with the
country and they know it. And one has no right, what's
more, to go wantonly plunging the country into the expenses
of these constant general elections. It ruins trade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Forlornly sticking to his point.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has
all this to do with Trebell?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Thoughtfully.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farrant, beyond what
you've told us, Percival didn't recommend me to throw
him over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he didn't&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is, he didn't exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to be accurate!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Obviously their
nerves are now on edge.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said we should find him
tough to assimilate&mdash;as he warned you.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>with knit brows, loses himself in thought
again</i>. <span class="smcap">blackborough</span> <i>quietly turns his attention
to</i> <span class="smcap">farrant</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farrant, you don't seriously think
that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. outside his undoubted capabilities&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trebell is an
acquisition to the party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Unwillingly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not. But if you're
going to chuck a man&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don't chuck him when he's
down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's no longer down. We've got
him O'Connell's promise and jolly grateful he ought to
be. I think the least we can do is to keep our minds clear
between Trebell's advantage and the party's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>From the distant music-stool.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the
party's and the Country's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Countering quite deftly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cantelupe,
either we think it best for the country to have our party in
power or we don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>In judicious temper.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, I don't
feel our responsibility towards him is what it was ten
minutes ago. The man has other careers besides his
political one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Ready to praise.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clever as paint

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not what he loses, I think&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
what we lose in losing him.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He says this so earnestly that</i> <span class="smcap">horsham</span> <i>pays attention</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my dear Charles, let us be practical.
If his position with us is to be made impossible it is better
that he shouldn't assume it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's always such a difficult sort of point
to determine, isn't it? He thinks he is to join us. But I've
not yet been commanded to form a cabinet. If neither
you&mdash;nor Percival&mdash;nor perhaps others will work with him
.&nbsp;. what am I to do?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He appeals to them generally to
justify this attitude.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">blackborough.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer thinks he's to join us&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
it's the question he left us to decide.</p>

with us now. There won't be any scandal&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there won't,
Blackborough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be. Though, I take it we're all
guiltless of having mentioned the matter.</p>

don't mind telling you now, Horsham, that ever since we
met at Shapters I've been wondering how you'd escape
from this association with Trebell. Thought he was
being very clever when he crossed the House to us! It's
needed a special providence. You'd never have got a
cabinet together to include him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">farrant.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Miserably.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I suppose that intrigue

Blackborough is a sensible fellow. I suppose it can't be

things keep our mental balance. Trebell is a most

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never any proof of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he bought off the husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>With elderly reproof.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think,
Charles, you have the least conception of what a nicely
balanced machine a cabinet is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Imploring comfort.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But should we have
held together through Trebell's bill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>A little impatient.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not. But
once I had them all round a table&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Trebell is very keen
on office for all his independent airs&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he and Percival
could have argued the thing out. However, it's too late
now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you see&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Percival I can't do without.
Now that Blackborough knows of his objections
to the finance he'd go to him and take Chisholm and offer
to back them up. I know he would&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he didn't take
Farrant away with him for nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Then he flashes out
rather shrilly.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Trebell's own fault. He ought not to
have committed himself definitely to any scheme until he
was safely in office. I warned him about Percival&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
warned him not to be explicit. One cannot work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think so. The split would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
come when Blackborough checkmated my forming a
cabinet. It would have pleased him to do that&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he
could have, over Trebell. But now that question's out of
the way&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you won't get such a bad measure with
Trebell in opposition. He'll frighten us into keeping it up
to the mark, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>A little comforted.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I shall miss

they'd have outlasted the second reading? Dullness in the
country one expects. Dullness in the House one can cope
with. But do you know, I have never sat in a cabinet
yet that didn't greet anything like a new idea in chilling
silence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">cantelupe.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I should regret to have caused you
trouble, Cyril.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">horsham.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>His hand on the other's shoulder.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

take that matter up very seriously.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

badly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;. either life is too little a thing to
matter or it's so big that such specks of it as we may be are
of no account. These are two points of view. And then
one has to consider if death can't be sometimes the last
use made of life.</p>

My dear fellow, Horsham would have thought it was the
shame and disgrace if you'd shot yourself after the inquest.
That's the proper sentimental thing for you so-called
strong men to do on like occasions. Why, if your name
were to come out to-morrow, your best meaning friends
would be sending you pistols by post, requesting you to
use them like a gentleman. Horsham would grieve over
ten dinner-tables in succession and then return to his
philosophy. One really mustn't waste a life trying to
shock polite politicians. There'd even be a suspicion of
swagger in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Power over men and women and contempt
for them! Do you think they don't take their revenge
sooner or later?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much good may it do them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human nature turns against you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by
instinct&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in self-defence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my own human-nature!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shocked into great pity, by his half articulate

some odd way. I'm sorry for you both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm hating her now&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a man can only
hate his own silliest vices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Flashing into defence.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's wrong of
you. If you thought of her only as a pretty little fool&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Bearing your child&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all her womanly life belonged to
you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and for that time there was no other sort of life
in her. So she became what you thought her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's true enough&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's true of men towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>

as one thing and then suddenly find them another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Hammering at his fixed idea.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She should
have brought that child into the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn't love her enough!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't love her at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then why should she value your gift?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For its own sake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Turning away.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's hopeless&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you don't

I've been trying to&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all through the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Turning back enlightened a little.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's
more the trouble then than the Cabinet question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Watching this new mood carefully.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
believe that you'll be missed from Lord Horsham's
Cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand-made statesman and his hand-made
measure! They were out of place in that pretty
Tory garden. Those men are the natural growth of the
time. Am I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as much. And wasn't your bill going
to be such a good piece of work? That can't be thrown
away&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wasted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can one impose a clever idea upon men and
women? I wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rather begs the question of your very

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry, I didn't mean that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I've a mind to put an end to
that same?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Belittling her fright.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for how
unreasonable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of my promising past. I've stood
for success, Fanny; I still stand for success. I could still
do more outside the Cabinet than the rest of them, inside,

barren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>His eyes shift beyond her; beyond the room.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is it in your thoughts and actions which makes them
bear fruit? Something that the roughest peasant may

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, I could go on earning useless money
at the Bar&nbsp;.&nbsp;. think how nice that would be. I could
blackmail the next judgeship out of Horsham. I think I
could even smash his Disestablishment Bill&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and perhaps
get into the next Liberal Cabinet and start my own all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>

any such things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one knows about you and poor Amy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All she had&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all there is left of her! She

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear, listen to me for a little. Consider
that as a sorrow and put it behind you. And think
now&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever love there may be between us has
neither hatred nor jealousy in it, has it, Henry? Since
I'm not a mistress or a friend but just the likest fellow-creature
to you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Putting out his hand for hers.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, my

been what I should have felt for you&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you'd ever made
a single demand on me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's go away somewhere&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'll make
demands. I need refreshing as much as you. My joy

now. We must kiss the earth again&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take interest in
common things, common people. There's so much of the
world we don't know. There's air to breathe everywhere.
Think of the flowers in a Tyrol valley in the early spring.
One can walk for days, not hurrying, as soon as the passes
are open. And the people are kind. There's Italy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
there's Russia full of simple folk. When we've learned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Shaking his head, unmoved.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear
sister&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I should be bored to death. The life contemplative
and peripatetic would literally bore me into a living
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Letting it be a fairy tale.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your mother
the Wide World nothing to you? Can't you open your
heart like a child again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, neither to the beauty of Nature nor the
particular human animals that are always called a part of
it. I don't even see them with your eyes. I'm a son of
the anger of Man at men's foolishness, and unless I've

Don't you know that when a man cuts himself shaving,
he swears? When he loses a seat in the Cabinet he turns
inward for comfort&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and if he only finds there a spirit
which should have been born, but is dead&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what's to be
done then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>In a whisper.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mustn't think of that

here's something in me which no knowledge touches&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
some feeling&nbsp;.&nbsp;. some power which should be the beginning
of new strength. But it has been killed in me unborn
before I had learnt to understand&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that's killing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Crying out.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why did no woman

woman? Perhaps even I am to blame.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little fool, the little fool&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why did
she kill my child? What did it matter what I thought
her? We were committed together to that one thing. Do
you think I didn't know that I was heartless and that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
was socially in the wrong? But what did Nature care
for that? And Nature has broken us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">frances.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Clinging to him as he beats the air.</i>]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
you. She's dead, poor girl&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but not you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that's the mystery no one need believe
till he has dipped in it. The man bears the child in his
soul as the woman carries it in her body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">trebell.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see, Fanny, as I said to Gilbert last
night&nbsp;.&nbsp;. our lives are our own and yet not our own. We
understand living for others and dying for others. The
first is easy&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it's a way out of boredom. To make the
second popular we had to invent a belief in personal resurrection.
Do you think we shall ever understand dying
in the sure and certain hope that it really doesn't matter&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

of the power in us after our death than men do while we

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
